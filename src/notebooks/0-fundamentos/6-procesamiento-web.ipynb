      "\n",
      "A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to\n",
      "understand his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working\n",
      "and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five\n",
      "children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings\n",
      "in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious\n",
      "character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the\n",
      "final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had\n",
      "already begun his first work, âPoor Folk.â\n",
      "\n",
      "This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and\n",
      "was received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself\n",
      "instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career\n",
      "seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he\n",
      "was arrested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky\n",
      "was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier\n",
      "and Proudhon. He was accused of âtaking part in conversations against\n",
      "the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\n",
      "knowing of the intention to set up a printing press.â Under Nicholas\n",
      "I. (that âstern and just man,â as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\n",
      "enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight monthsâ imprisonment\n",
      "he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\n",
      "be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: âThey snapped\n",
      "words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\n",
      "persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\n",
      "to suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\n",
      "a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\n",
      "I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\n",
      "bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\n",
      "brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\n",
      "us our lives.â The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\n",
      "never regained his sanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\n",
      "Dostoevskyâs mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\n",
      "accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\n",
      "in his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\n",
      "He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\n",
      "cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\n",
      "servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\n",
      "he began the âDead House,â and some years of service in a disciplinary\n",
      "battalion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\n",
      "and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\n",
      "suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\n",
      "a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\n",
      "allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--âVremya,â which was\n",
      "forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\n",
      "his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\n",
      "he took upon himself the payment of his brotherâs debts. He started\n",
      "another journal--âThe Epoch,â which within a few months was also\n",
      "prohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brotherâs family was\n",
      "dependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\n",
      "said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\n",
      "much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\n",
      "monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\n",
      "demonstrations of love and honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\n",
      "vast multitude of mourners, who âgave the hapless man the funeral of a\n",
      "king.â He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\n",

      "\n",
      "On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\n",
      "the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\n",
      "in hesitation, towards K. bridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\n",
      "garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\n",
      "like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\n",
      "dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\n",
      "he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\n",
      "invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\n",
      "sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\n",
      "hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\n",
      "for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\n",
      "verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\n",
      "himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\n",
      "only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\n",
      "anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\n",
      "given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\n",
      "desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\n",
      "for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\n",
      "trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\n",
      "and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\n",
      "lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\n",
      "slip out unseen.\n",
      "\n",
      "This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\n",
      "aware of his fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\n",
      "trifles,â he thought, with an odd smile. âHm... yes, all is in a manâs\n",
      "hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, thatâs an axiom. It would\n",
      "be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\n",
      "step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\n",
      "too much. Itâs because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\n",
      "that I chatter because I do nothing. Iâve learned to chatter this\n",
      "last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\n",
      "Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\n",
      "_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. Itâs simply a fantasy to amuse\n",
      "myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\n",
      "and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\n",
      "special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\n",
      "of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young manâs already\n",
      "overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\n",
      "are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\n",
      "whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\n",
      "the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\n",
      "disgust gleamed for a moment in the young manâs refined face. He was,\n",
      "by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\n",
      "well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\n",
      "into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\n",
      "of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\n",
      "to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\n",
      "habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\n",
      "moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\n",
      "tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\n",
      "food.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\n",
      "have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\n",
      "of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\n",
      "created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\n",
      "of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\n",
      "and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\n",
      "heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\n",
      "that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\n",
      "such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young manâs heart, that,\n",
      "in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\n",
      "of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\n",
      "acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\n",
      "meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\n",
      "reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\n",
      "dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: âHey there, German\n",
      "hatterâ bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\n",
      "man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\n",
      "round hat from Zimmermanâs, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\n",
      "torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\n",
      "fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\n",
      "had overtaken him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI knew it,â he muttered in confusion, âI thought so! Thatâs the worst\n",
      "of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\n",
      "spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\n",
      "and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\n",
      "sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\n",
      "a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\n",
      "matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\n",
      "a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\n",
      "possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, itâs just such\n",
      "trifles that always ruin everything....â\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\n",
      "of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\n",
      "them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\n",
      "faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\n",
      "but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\n",
      "them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\n",
      "his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\n",
      "this âhideousâ dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\n",
      "still did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\n",
      "ârehearsalâ of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\n",
      "and more violent.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\n",
      "which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\n",
      "street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\n",
      "working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\n",
      "sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\n",
      "There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\n",
      "two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\n",
      "the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\n",
      "at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\n",
      "staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\n",
      "with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\n",
      "in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\n",
      "I were really going to do it?â he could not help asking himself as he\n",
      "reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\n",
      "who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\n",
      "flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\n",
      "family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\n",
      "staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. âThatâs a good\n",
      "thing anyway,â he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\n",
      "womanâs flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\n",
      "tin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\n",
      "that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\n",
      "its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\n",
      "clearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\n",
      "by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\n",
      "woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\n",
      "nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\n",
      "But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\n",
      "opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\n",
      "was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\n",
      "him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\n",
      "withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\n",
      "little nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\n",
      "with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\n",
      "which looked like a henâs leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\n",
      "and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\n",
      "fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\n",
      "instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\n",
      "expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\n",
      "\n",
      "âRaskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,â the young man made\n",
      "haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\n",
      "polite.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,â the\n",
      "old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd here... I am again on the same errand,â Raskolnikov continued, a\n",
      "little disconcerted and surprised at the old womanâs mistrust. âPerhaps\n",
      "she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\n",
      "time,â he thought with an uneasy feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\n",
      "and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\n",
      "in front of her:\n",
      "\n",
      "âStep in, my good sir.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\n",
      "the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\n",
      "lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo the sun will shine like this _then_ too!â flashed as it were by\n",
      "chance through Raskolnikovâs mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\n",
      "everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\n",
      "remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\n",
      "furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\n",
      "a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\n",
      "dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\n",
      "chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\n",
      "frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\n",
      "all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\n",
      "was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\n",
      "everything shone.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLizavetaâs work,â thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\n",
      "to be seen in the whole flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\n",
      "cleanliness,â Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\n",
      "at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\n",
      "which stood the old womanâs bed and chest of drawers and into which he\n",
      "had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat do you want?â the old woman said severely, coming into the room\n",
      "and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\n",
      "the face.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâve brought something to pawn here,â and he drew out of his pocket\n",
      "an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\n",
      "globe; the chain was of steel.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\n",
      "before yesterday.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut thatâs for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\n",
      "your pledge at once.â\n",
      "\n",

      "felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking\n",
      "place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He\n",
      "was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy\n",

      "with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an\n",
      "iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was\n",
      "another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the\n",
      "counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and\n",
      "some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably\n",
      "close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such\n",

      "like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression\n",
      "afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly\n",
      "at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring\n",
      "persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\n",
      "the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk\n",
      "looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing\n",
      "a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and\n",
      "culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to\n",
      "converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,\n",
      "and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of\n",
      "a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen\n",
      "reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very\n",
      "strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense\n",
      "feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the\n",
      "same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an\n",
      "old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing\n",
      "except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this\n",
      "last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots\n",
      "and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore\n",
      "no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin\n",
      "looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable\n",
      "and like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he\n",
      "ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his\n",

      "fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite\n",
      "probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.\n",
      "His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black\n",
      "nails.\n",

      "wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,\n",
      "especially when Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, relapsing into his old regimental\n",
      "habits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it\n",
      "was all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had\n",
      "conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed\n",
      "it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and\n",
      "horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and\n",
      "his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\n",
      "And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide\n",
      "the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face\n",
      "to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\n",
      "inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\n",
      "to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went\n",
      "through! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\n",
      "account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\n",
      "Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\n",
      "would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would\n",
      "have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\n",
      "inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\n",
      "not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\n",
      "Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\n",
      "has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\n",
      "she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write\n",
      "to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were\n",
      "constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa\n",
      "Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\n",
      "garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\n",
      "the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful\n",
      "scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\n",
      "went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\n",
      "shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\n",
      "be packed off at once to me in a plain peasantâs cart, into which they\n",
      "flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\n",
      "folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\n",
      "and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\n",
      "open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer\n",
      "could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and\n",
      "what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to\n",
      "you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified\n",
      "and indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin\n",
      "yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter\n",
      "with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a\n",
      "whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came\n",
      "to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account\n",
      "of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about\n",
      "us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the\n",
      "street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to\n",
      "insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,\n",
      "so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set\n",
      "going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at\n",
      "her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that\n",
      "month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is\n",
      "rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and\n",
      "particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not\n",
      "at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in\n",
      "the town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but\n",
      "Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how\n",
      "she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is\n",
      "an angel! But by Godâs mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov returned to his senses and repented and, probably\n",
      "feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and\n",
      "unmistakable proof of Douniaâs innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia\n",
      "had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna\n",
      "came upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lovâs hands after her departure, she had written to refuse\n",
      "personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating\n",
      "her. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation\n",
      "for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding\n",
      "him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how\n",
      "infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,\n",
      "unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\n",
      "touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\n",
      "read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,\n",
      "cleared Douniaâs reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more\n",
      "than Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case\n",
      "with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and âagain\n",
      "crushedâ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of\n",
      "Douniaâs innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight\n",
      "to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give\n",
      "her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she\n",
      "came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept\n",
      "bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to\n",
      "forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all\n",
      "the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in\n",
      "the most flattering terms Douniaâs innocence and the nobility of\n",
      "her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\n",
      "everyone the letter in Douniaâs own handwriting to Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov and\n",
      "even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\n",
      "superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\n",
      "the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\n",
      "having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so\n",
      "that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\n",
      "knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\n",
      "letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\n",
      "of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\n",
      "own houses and in other peopleâs. In my opinion a great deal, a very\n",
      "great deal of all this was unnecessary; but thatâs Marfa Petrovnaâs\n",
      "character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Douniaâs\n",
      "reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible\n",
      "disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really\n",
      "began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\n",
      "harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\n",
      "but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\n",
      "respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\n",
      "say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,\n",
      "that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\n",
      "him. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\n",
      "arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\n",
      "with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\n",
      "could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you\n",
      "could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This\n",
      "was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\n",
      "Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\n",
      "has been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his\n",
      "expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was\n",
      "properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\n",
      "us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\n",
      "speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\n",
      "to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,\n",
      "of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\n",
      "and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a\n",
      "well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\n",
      "and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years\n",
      "old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\n",
      "thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\n",
      "presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.\n",
      "But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.\n",
      "And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\n",
      "do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\n",
      "there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this\n",
      "warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\n",
      "upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\n",
      "deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\n",
      "which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\n",
      "Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.\n",
      "At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\n",
      "still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions âof our\n",
      "most rising generationâ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He\n",
      "said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\n",
      "listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very\n",
      "little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\n",
      "of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know\n",
      "your sisterâs character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\n",
      "generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\n",
      "Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\n",
      "Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\n",
      "it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\n",
      "happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\n",
      "must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he\n",
      "is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\n",
      "his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\n",
      "him. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\n",
      "certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\n",
      "the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\n",
      "relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\n",
      "that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\n",
      "relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,\n",
      "for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\n",
      "from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\n",
      "instance, at his second visit, after he had received Douniaâs consent,\n",
      "in the course of conversation, he declared that before making\n",
      "Douniaâs acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\n",
      "good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\n",
      "poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\n",
      "wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\n",
      "benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\n",
      "than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\n",
      "remember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\n",
      "but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\n",
      "to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\n",
      "me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was\n",
      "vexed, and answered that âwords are not deeds,â and that, of course, is\n",
      "perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\n",
      "her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\n",
      "walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\n",
      "the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\n",
      "that she had decided.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\n",
      "Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\n",
      "a legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\n",
      "and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\n",
      "case. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\n",
      "the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\n",
      "every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\n",
      "you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\n",
      "your future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to\n",
      "pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\n",
      "providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even\n",
      "ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.\n",
      "He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\n",
      "get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\n",
      "a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\n",
      "duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then\n",
      "he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\n",
      "you time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but\n",
      "Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever\n",
      "for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\n",
      "your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\n",
      "Petrovitchâs business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\n",
      "student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\n",
      "all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\n",
      "realising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitchâs evasiveness, very\n",
      "natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\n",
      "persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\n",
      "future husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful\n",
      "not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\n",
      "especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might\n",
      "take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor\n",
      "has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\n",
      "of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\n",
      "of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\n",
      "later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\n",
      "himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\n",
      "you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\n",
      "receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\n",
      "own work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\n",
      "with her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\n",
      "is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\n",
      "you first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\n",
      "you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\n",
      "him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\n",
      "opinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious\n",
      "Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\n",
      "Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\n",
      "fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\n",
      "them, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and\n",
      "delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\n",
      "for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\n",
      "simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have\n",
      "noticed more than once in my life that husbands donât quite get on with\n",
      "their mothers-in-law, and I donât want to be the least bit in anyoneâs\n",
      "way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\n",
      "long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\n",
      "Dounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\n",
      "joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\n",
      "know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\n",
      "very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\n",
      "almost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\n",
      "set off for Petersburg, exactly when I donât know, but very, very soon,\n",
      "possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\n",
      "know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his\n",
      "own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\n",
      "even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\n",
      "too soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall\n",
      "press you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\n",
      "of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing\n",
      "anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\n",
      "so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\n",
      "a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\n",
      "herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But\n",
      "although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\n",
      "money as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\n",
      "is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know\n",
      "that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles\n",
      "on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\n",
      "you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\n",
      "uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\n",
      "been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\n",
      "is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\n",
      "trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we\n",
      "must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\n",
      "canât be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But\n",
      "we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\n",
      "that the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from\n",
      "us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\n",
      "know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\n",
      "quite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send\n",
      "to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered\n",
      "two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\n",
      "history, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,\n",

      "strange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl\n",
      "quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with\n",
      "no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had\n",
      "on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not\n",
      "properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the\n",
      "waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was\n",
      "flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was\n",
      "walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She\n",
      "drew Raskolnikovâs whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the\n",

      "she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,\n",
      "apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once\n",
      "that she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He\n",
      "could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the\n",
      "face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than\n",
      "fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking\n",
      "and, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was\n",

      "showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.\n",
      "\n",

      "deserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen\n",
      "paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,\n",

      "him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding\n",
      "his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His\n",
      "intentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set\n",
      "man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and\n",
      "moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult\n",

      "towards the gentleman.\n",
      "\n",

      "himself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a\n",
      "police constable stood between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What\n",

      "somewhere... for the first time... you understand? and theyâve put her\n",
      "out into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and\n",

      "not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a manâs hands;\n",
      "thatâs evident. And now look there: I donât know that dandy with whom I\n",

      "\n",
      "âAh, what a pity!â he said, shaking his head--âwhy, she is quite a\n",

      "you live?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âGo away! They wonât let me alone,â the girl muttered, and once more\n",
      "waved her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAch, ach, how shocking! Itâs shameful, missy, itâs a shame!â He shook\n",

      "\n",
      "âItâs a difficult job,â the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he\n",
      "did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have\n",
      "seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!\n",
      "\n",
      "âDid you meet her far from here?â he asked him.\n",
      "\n",

      "âAh, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have\n",

      "deceived, thatâs a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....\n",
      "Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to\n",
      "gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.\n",

      "In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on\n",
      "the deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard\n",
      "to fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself\n",
      "altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life\n",
      "anew....\n",
      "\n",
      "âPoor girl!â he said, looking at the empty corner where she had\n",

      "He wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the\n",

      "the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did\n",
      "not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave\n",
      "him up. He took no part in the studentsâ gatherings, amusements or\n",
      "conversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,\n",
      "and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,\n",
      "and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though\n",
      "he were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades\n",
      "to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in\n",
      "development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and\n",
      "interests were beneath him.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and\n",
      "communicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other\n",
      "terms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid\n",
      "youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and\n",
      "dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades\n",
      "understood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,\n",
      "though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking\n",
      "appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was\n",
      "sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.\n",
      "One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid\n",
      "a gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking\n",
      "powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went\n",
      "too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.\n",
      "Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and\n",
      "it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He\n",
      "could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was\n",
      "very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of\n",
      "one sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn\n",
      "money. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to\n",
      "declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in\n",
      "the cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the\n",
      "university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his\n",
      "might to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had\n",
      "not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even\n",
      "know his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,\n",
      "but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that\n",

      "\n",
      "His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel\n",
      "shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he\n",
      "began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all\n",
      "the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his\n",
      "attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into\n",
      "brooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,\n",
      "he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he\n",
      "was going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came\n",
      "out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the\n",
      "islands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary\n",
      "eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in\n",
      "and weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,\n",
      "no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid\n",

      "villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw\n",
      "in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,\n",
      "and children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his\n",
      "attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by\n",
      "luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them\n",
      "with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from\n",
      "his sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had\n",
      "thirty copecks. âTwenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the\n",

      "though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and\n",
      "a great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching\n",

      "walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It\n",
      "was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;\n",
      "indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in\n",
      "memory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not\n",
      "even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark\n",
      "blur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market\n",
      "garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a\n",
      "feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.\n",
      "There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,\n",
      "hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking\n",
      "figures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his\n",
      "father, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road\n",
      "became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a\n",
      "winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the\n",
      "right to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone\n",
      "church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three\n",
      "times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in\n",
      "memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never\n",
      "seen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a\n",
      "table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in\n",
      "the shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned\n",
      "ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmotherâs\n",
      "grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger\n",

      "but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited\n",

      "to bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was\n",
      "walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he\n",
      "was holding his fatherâs hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A\n",
      "peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be\n",
      "some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed\n",
      "townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,\n",
      "all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern\n",
      "stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually\n",
      "drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy\n",
      "goods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their\n",
      "long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect\n",
      "mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going\n",
      "with a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of\n",
      "such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasantsâ\n",
      "nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load\n",
      "of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in\n",
      "a rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even\n",
      "about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that\n",
      "he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the\n",
      "window. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing\n",
      "and the balalaÃ¯ka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken\n",

      "The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help\n",
      "laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a\n",

      "but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with\n",
      "her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which\n",
      "were showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the\n",
      "crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed\n",
      "the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.\n",

      "with fury.\n",

      "âCome along, come along!â said his father. âThey are drunken and\n",

      "him away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself\n",

      "lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on\n",
      "one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six\n",
      "whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised\n",
      "again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured\n",
      "blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.\n",

      "the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. âLook\n",
      "out,â he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the\n",

      "He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at\n",
      "finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,\n",

      "to breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that\n",
      "had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense\n",
      "of relief and peace in his soul. âLord,â he prayed, âshow me my path--I\n",

      "freedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during\n",
      "those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously\n",
      "impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very\n",
      "exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined\n",
      "turning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to\n",
      "himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been\n",
      "more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,\n",
      "he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was\n",
      "obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It\n",
      "is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without\n",
      "noticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking\n",
      "himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time\n",
      "such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he\n",
      "had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his\n",
      "life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances\n",
      "in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive\n",

      "him on purpose!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about nine oâclock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables\n",
      "and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were\n",
      "closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their\n",
      "wares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and\n",
      "costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty\n",
      "and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly\n",
      "liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly\n",
      "in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,\n",
      "and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At\n",
      "the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out\n",
      "with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to\n",
      "go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just\n",
      "come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone\n",
      "called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona\n",
      "Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his\n",
      "watch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta\n",
      "and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about\n",
      "thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was\n",
      "a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who\n",
      "made her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with\n",
      "a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and\n",
      "doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The\n",
      "moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange\n",

      "\n",
      "âYou could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,â the\n",

      "âUpon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,â gabbled\n",

      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,\n",
      "unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed\n",

      "\n",
      "He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man\n",
      "condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;\n",

      "of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably\n",
      "decided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he\n",
      "could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan\n",
      "than that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have\n",
      "been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with\n",
      "greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and\n",

      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his\n",
      "wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was\n",
      "nothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been\n",
      "reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all\n",
      "womenâs things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,\n",
      "they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizavetaâs business. She\n",
      "undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest\n",
      "and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule\n",
      "little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of\n",
      "superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.\n",
      "And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something\n",
      "strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar\n",
      "influences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew\n",
      "called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to\n",
      "give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he\n",
      "might want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for\n",
      "he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had\n",
      "remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his\n",
      "fatherâs old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,\n",
      "a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When\n",
      "he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her\n",
      "at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got\n",
      "two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way\n",
      "home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange\n",
      "idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very\n",
      "much absorbed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he\n",
      "did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had\n",
      "played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard\n",
      "the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and\n",
      "give him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he\n",
      "had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course\n",
      "it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary\n",
      "impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;\n",
      "the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona\n",
      "Ivanovna.\n",
      "\n",
      "âShe is first-rate,â he said. âYou can always get money from her. She is\n",
      "as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and\n",
      "she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have\n",
      "had dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....â\n",
      "\n",
      "And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you\n",
      "were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she\n",
      "gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven\n",
      "percent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying\n",
      "that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was\n",
      "continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,\n",
      "though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThereâs a phenomenon for you,â cried the student and he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a\n",
      "peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened\n",
      "with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending\n",
      "for him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about\n",
      "her. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,\n",
      "being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked\n",
      "day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the\n",
      "washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister\n",
      "all she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind\n",
      "without her sisterâs permission. The old woman had already made her\n",
      "will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a\n",

      "would be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives\n",

      "\n",
      "He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were\n",
      "mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself\n",
      "on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,\n",
      "with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such\n",
      "strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was\n",
      "in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,\n",
      "the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a\n",
      "complete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water\n",
      "from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was\n",
      "wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured\n",
      "stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like\n",
      "gold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,\n",
      "raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,\n",
      "suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the\n",
      "sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began\n",
      "listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet\n",
      "on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and\n",
      "monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the\n",
      "previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And\n",
      "meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction\n",
      "were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted\n",
      "haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his\n",
      "energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart\n",
      "kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had\n",
      "to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He\n",
      "rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away\n",
      "under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long\n",
      "strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded\n",
      "this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some\n",
      "stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two\n",
      "ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook\n",
      "as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside\n",
      "when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready\n",
      "long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the\n",
      "noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended\n",
      "for the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the\n",
      "street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have\n",
      "had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now\n",
      "he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang\n",
      "quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat\n",
      "pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did\n",
      "not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it\n",
      "could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the\n",
      "hand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a\n",
      "fortnight before.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening\n",
      "between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out\n",
      "the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This\n",
      "pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and\n",
      "thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood\n",
      "in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of\n",
      "a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece\n",
      "of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.\n",
      "Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,\n",
      "he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round\n",
      "them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and\n",
      "tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This\n",
      "was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while\n",
      "she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip\n",
      "was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first\n",
      "minute that the âthingâ was made of wood. All this had been stored by\n",
      "him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when\n",
      "he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt struck six long ago.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âLong ago! My God!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend\n",
      "his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the\n",
      "most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the\n",
      "deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a\n",
      "pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less\n",
      "on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in\n",
      "passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by\n",
      "him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final\n",
      "they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in\n",
      "his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for\n",
      "a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his\n",
      "plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point\n",
      "could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of\n",
      "any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all\n",
      "as something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of\n",
      "unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,\n",
      "that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.\n",
      "Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;\n",
      "she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the\n",
      "door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her\n",
      "about. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into\n",
      "the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything\n",
      "was over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.\n",
      "Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had\n",
      "come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait\n",
      "till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss\n",
      "the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at\n",
      "least grounds for suspicion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and\n",
      "indeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off\n",
      "trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed\n",
      "utterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not\n",
      "imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get\n",
      "up and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with\n",
      "the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at\n",
      "an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say\n",
      "âcome, let us go and try it--why dream about it!â--and at once he\n",
      "had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.\n",
      "Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his\n",
      "analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he\n",
      "could not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort\n",
      "he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought\n",
      "arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were\n",
      "forcing and drawing him to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one\n",
      "question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily\n",
      "detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He\n",
      "had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his\n",
      "opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility\n",
      "of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every\n",
      "criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a\n",
      "childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence\n",
      "and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse\n",
      "of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,\n",
      "developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the\n",
      "perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment\n",
      "of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the\n",
      "individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The\n",
      "question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the\n",
      "crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of\n",
      "the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there\n",
      "could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would\n",
      "remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the\n",
      "simple reason that his design was ânot a crime....â We will omit all the\n",
      "process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have\n",
      "run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely\n",
      "material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his\n",
      "mind. âOne has but to keep all oneâs will-power and reason to deal\n",
      "with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has\n",
      "familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....â But\n",
      "this preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he\n",
      "came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite\n",
      "differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even\n",
      "left the staircase. When he reached the landladyâs kitchen, the door\n",
      "of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in\n",
      "Nastasyaâs absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether\n",
      "the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when\n",
      "he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly\n",
      "saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied\n",
      "there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing\n",
      "him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him\n",
      "all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as\n",
      "though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not\n",
      "the axe! He was overwhelmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat made me think,â he reflected, as he went under the gateway, âwhat\n",
      "made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!\n",
      "Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?â\n",
      "\n",
      "He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in\n",
      "his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk\n",
      "for appearanceâ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more\n",
      "revolting. âAnd what a chance I have lost for ever!â he muttered,\n",
      "standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porterâs little\n",
      "dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porterâs\n",
      "room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the\n",
      "right caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the\n",
      "room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called\n",
      "the porter. âYes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for\n",
      "the door is wide open.â He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled\n",
      "it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;\n",
      "at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both\n",
      "hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!\n",
      "âWhen reason fails, the devil helps!â he thought with a strange grin.\n",
      "This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening\n",
      "suspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking\n",
      "at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.\n",
      "Suddenly he thought of his hat. âGood heavens! I had the money the day\n",
      "before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!â A curse rose\n",
      "from the bottom of his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on\n",
      "the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at\n",
      "the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the\n",
      "other side....\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes\n",

      "afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied\n",

      "garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great\n",
      "fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all\n",
      "the squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer\n",
      "garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the\n",
      "garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a\n",
      "great benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why\n",
      "in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some\n",
      "peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there\n",
      "are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all\n",
      "sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back\n",
      "to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. âWhat nonsense!â\n",
      " he thought, âbetter think of nothing at all!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that\n",
      "meets them on the way,â flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,\n",
      "like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now\n",
      "he was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock\n",
      "somewhere struck once. âWhat! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it\n",
      "must be fast!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very\n",
      "moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had\n",
      "just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under\n",
      "the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into\n",
      "the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other\n",
      "side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one\n",
      "noticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge\n",
      "quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his\n",
      "head--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old\n",
      "womanâs room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was\n",
      "already on the stairs....\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and\n",
      "once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly\n",
      "and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the\n",
      "stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no\n",
      "one. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were\n",
      "at work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought\n",
      "a minute and went on. âOf course it would be better if they had not been\n",
      "here, but... itâs two storeys above them.â\n",
      "\n",
      "And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the\n",
      "flat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old womanâs was\n",
      "apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been\n",
      "torn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant\n",
      "the thought floated through his mind âShall I go back?â But he made no\n",
      "answer and began listening at the old womanâs door, a dead silence. Then\n",
      "he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...\n",
      "then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew\n",
      "himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. âAm I very pale?â\n",
      " he wondered. âAm I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I\n",
      "better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?â\n",
      "\n",
      "But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite\n",
      "him, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,\n",
      "he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he\n",
      "rang again, more loudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman\n",
      "was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some\n",
      "knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.\n",
      "Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to\n",
      "suppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly\n",
      "heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the\n",
      "rustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily\n",
      "close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly\n",
      "listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved\n",
      "a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have\n",
      "the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,\n",
      "and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out\n",
      "in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he\n",
      "had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and\n",
      "he was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the\n",

      "mistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer\n",
      "in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that\n",
      "he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened\n",
      "that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half\n",
      "minute, he thought he would have run away from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy do you look at me as though you did not know me?â he said suddenly,\n",

      "in a hurry.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of\n",

      "\n",
      "His strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the\n",
      "truth; the old woman took the pledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat is it?â she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and\n",

      "âA thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.â\n",

      "him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He\n",
      "unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet\n",
      "take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the\n",
      "coat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing\n",
      "more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and\n",
      "fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut what has he tied it up like this for?â the old woman cried with\n",
      "vexation and moved towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung\n",
      "it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without\n",
      "effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He\n",
      "seemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once\n",
      "brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked\n",
      "with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a ratâs tail and\n",
      "fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.\n",
      "As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She\n",
      "cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the\n",
      "floor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held âthe\n",
      "pledge.â Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side\n",
      "and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the\n",
      "body fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her\n",
      "face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,\n",
      "the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her\n",
      "pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket\n",
      "from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full\n",
      "possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his\n",
      "hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been\n",
      "particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get\n",
      "smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,\n",
      "as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom\n",
      "with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.\n",
      "Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with\n",
      "a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of\n",
      "drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the\n",
      "chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed\n",
      "over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go\n",
      "away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.\n",
      "He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea\n",
      "occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be\n",
      "still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,\n",
      "he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more\n",
      "over the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that\n",
      "she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw\n",
      "clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He\n",
      "was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed\n",
      "it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of\n",
      "blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but\n",
      "the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked\n",
      "with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but\n",
      "something held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised\n",
      "the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not\n",
      "dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,\n",
      "after two minutesâ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off\n",
      "without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a\n",
      "purse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of\n",
      "copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy\n",
      "chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed\n",
      "very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,\n",
      "flung the crosses on the old womanâs body and rushed back into the\n",
      "bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them\n",
      "again. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It\n",
      "was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making\n",
      "mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one\n",
      "and would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered\n",
      "and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging\n",
      "there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of\n",
      "drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,\n",
      "and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest\n",
      "of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old\n",
      "women usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a\n",
      "good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched\n",
      "lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched\n",
      "key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was\n",
      "a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,\n",
      "then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but\n",
      "clothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on\n",
      "the red brocade. âItâs red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,â\n",
      " the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.\n",
      "âGood God, am I going out of my senses?â he thought with terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from\n",
      "under the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned\n",
      "out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably\n",
      "all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,\n",
      "ear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply\n",
      "wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with\n",
      "tape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers\n",
      "and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he\n",
      "had not time to take many....\n",
      "\n",
      "He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped\n",
      "short and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been\n",
      "his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though\n",
      "someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for\n",
      "a minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited\n",
      "holding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of\n",
      "the bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.\n",
      "She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet\n",
      "and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out\n",
      "of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a\n",
      "shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but\n",
      "still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the\n",
      "corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no\n",
      "sound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her\n",
      "with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babiesâ mouths,\n",
      "when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them\n",
      "and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so\n",
      "simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not\n",
      "even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary\n",
      "and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.\n",
      "She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding\n",
      "it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the\n",
      "sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the\n",
      "head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,\n",
      "snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this\n",
      "second, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place\n",
      "as fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing\n",
      "and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the\n",
      "difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the\n",
      "absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,\n",
      "perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of\n",
      "that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would\n",
      "have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and\n",
      "not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had\n",
      "done. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew\n",
      "stronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even\n",
      "into the room for anything in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take\n",
      "possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what\n",
      "was of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the\n",
      "kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought\n",
      "him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.\n",
      "He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap\n",
      "that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands\n",
      "in the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the\n",
      "blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where\n",
      "there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all\n",
      "with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and\n",
      "then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.\n",
      "There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He\n",
      "carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was\n",
      "possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,\n",
      "his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be\n",
      "nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.\n",
      "But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something\n",
      "quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the\n",
      "room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea\n",
      "that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,\n",
      "of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something\n",
      "utterly different from what he was now doing. âGood God!â he muttered âI\n",
      "must fly, fly,â and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror\n",
      "awaited him such as he had never known before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer\n",
      "door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,\n",
      "was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,\n",
      "all the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him\n",
      "perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta\n",
      "afterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that\n",
      "she must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!\n",
      "\n",
      "He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....â\n",
      "\n",
      "He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the\n",
      "staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,\n",
      "two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.\n",
      "âWhat are they about?â He waited patiently. At last all was still, as\n",
      "though suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,\n",
      "but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone\n",
      "began going downstairs humming a tune. âHow is it they all make such\n",
      "a noise?â flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and\n",
      "waited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a\n",

      "\n",
      "The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but\n",
      "he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he\n",
      "began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,\n",
      "to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow\n",
      "peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now\n",
      "_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was\n",
      "growing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And\n",
      "now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to\n",
      "him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream\n",
      "in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is\n",
      "rooted to the spot and cannot even move oneâs arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly\n",
      "started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the\n",
      "flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,\n",
      "noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had\n",
      "done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown\n",
      "visitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one\n",
      "another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when\n",
      "the door divided them and he was listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visitor panted several times. âHe must be a big, fat man,â thought\n",
      "Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream\n",
      "indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of\n",
      "something moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite\n",
      "seriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently\n",
      "and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror\n",
      "at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every\n",
      "minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem\n",
      "possible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the\n",
      "fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him\n",
      "again. âI shall fall down!â flashed through his mind, but the unknown\n",
      "began to speak and he recovered himself at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhatâs up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!â he bawled in a\n",
      "thick voice, âHey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,\n",
      "my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?â\n",
      "\n",
      "And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at\n",
      "the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the\n",
      "stairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at\n",
      "first.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou donât say thereâs no one at home,â the new-comer cried in a\n",
      "cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on\n",
      "pulling the bell. âGood evening, Koch.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âFrom his voice he must be quite young,â thought Raskolnikov.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWho the devil can tell? Iâve almost broken the lock,â answered Koch.\n",
      "âBut how do you come to know me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo they are not at home? Thatâs queer. Itâs awfully stupid though.\n",
      "Where could the old woman have gone? Iâve come on business.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes; and I have business with her, too.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to\n",
      "get some money!â cried the young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWe must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The\n",
      "old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. Itâs out of my way.\n",
      "And where the devil she can have got to, I canât make out. She sits here\n",
      "from yearâs end to yearâs end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet\n",
      "here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHadnât we better ask the porter?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhere sheâs gone and when sheâll be back.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go\n",
      "anywhere.â\n",
      "\n",
      "And he once more tugged at the door-handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDamn it all. Thereâs nothing to be done, we must go!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âStay!â cried the young man suddenly. âDo you see how the door shakes if\n",
      "you pull it?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat shows itâs not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how\n",
      "the hook clanks?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, donât you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they\n",
      "were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the\n",
      "key and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook\n",
      "is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,\n",
      "donât you see. So there they are sitting inside and donât open the\n",
      "door!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell! And so they must be!â cried Koch, astonished. âWhat are they\n",
      "about in there?â And he began furiously shaking the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "âStay!â cried the young man again. âDonât pull at it! There must be\n",
      "something wrong.... Here, youâve been ringing and pulling at the door\n",
      "and still they donât open! So either theyâve both fainted or...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI tell you what. Letâs go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAll right.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Both were going down.\n",
      "\n",

      "âIâm studying the law you see! Itâs evident, e-vi-dent thereâs something\n",
      "wrong here!â the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one\n",
      "tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began\n",
      "touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once\n",
      "more that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he\n",
      "bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock\n",
      "on the inside and so nothing could be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of\n",
      "delirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.\n",
      "While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times\n",
      "occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the\n",
      "door. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,\n",
      "while they could not open the door! âOnly make haste!â was the thought\n",
      "that flashed through his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut what the devil is he about?...â Time was passing, one minute, and\n",
      "another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat the devil?â he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his\n",
      "sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy\n",
      "boots on the stairs. The steps died away.\n",
      "\n",
      "âGood heavens! What am I to do?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.\n",
      "Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as\n",
      "thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice\n",
      "below--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going\n",
      "back to the flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHey there! Catch the brute!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran\n",
      "down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!â\n",
      "\n",
      "The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was\n",
      "still. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began\n",
      "noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He\n",
      "distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. âHey!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling âcome what\n",
      "must!â If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was\n",
      "lost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only\n",
      "a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the\n",
      "right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the\n",
      "second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though\n",
      "for his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just\n",
      "run down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle\n",
      "of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one\n",
      "instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall\n",
      "and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.\n",
      "Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He\n",
      "waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through\n",
      "the gateway and turned to the left in the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the\n",
      "flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as\n",
      "the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the\n",
      "bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and\n",
      "completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had\n",
      "succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would\n",
      "guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were\n",
      "going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though\n",
      "the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. âShould he\n",
      "slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,\n",
      "hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,\n",
      "hopeless!â\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.\n",
      "Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky\n",
      "because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a\n",
      "grain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could\n",
      "scarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.\n",
      "âMy word, he has been going it!â someone shouted at him when he came out\n",
      "on the canal bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the\n",
      "worse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal\n",
      "bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more\n",
      "conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost\n",
      "falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from\n",
      "quite a different direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his\n",
      "house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.\n",
      "And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to\n",
      "escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course\n",
      "incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to\n",
      "restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebodyâs yard. But\n",
      "it all happened fortunately, the door of the porterâs room was closed\n",
      "but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at\n",
      "home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he\n",
      "walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,\n",
      "âWhat do you want?â he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But\n",
      "again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe\n",
      "back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as\n",
      "before. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;\n",
      "the landladyâs door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself\n",
      "on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank\n",
      "forgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have\n",
      "jumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were\n",
      "simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could\n",

      "Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he\n",

      "For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came\n",
      "over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in\n",
      "his sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his\n",
      "teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and\n",
      "began listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he\n",
      "gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he\n",
      "could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have\n",
      "flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his\n",
      "hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That Iâm drunk\n",
      "but...â\n",
      "\n",
      "He rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly\n",
      "looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there\n",
      "no traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he\n",
      "began taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything\n",
      "over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through\n",
      "his search three times.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where\n",
      "some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge\n",
      "of his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed\n",
      "threads. There seemed to be nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of\n",
      "the old womanâs box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till\n",
      "then of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them\n",
      "while he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed\n",
      "to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out\n",
      "everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was\n",
      "nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had\n",
      "come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began\n",
      "stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: âTheyâre in! All\n",
      "out of sight, and the purse too!â he thought gleefully, getting up and\n",
      "gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly\n",
      "he shuddered all over with horror; âMy God!â he whispered in despair:\n",
      "âwhatâs the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide\n",
      "things?â\n",
      "\n",

      "money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.\n",

      "âBut now, now, what am I glad of?â he thought, âIs that hiding things?\n",
      "My reasonâs deserting me--simply!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another\n",
      "unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside\n",
      "him his old studentâs winter coat, which was still warm though almost in\n",
      "rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and\n",
      "delirium. He lost consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,\n",
      "and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not\n",
      "taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!\n",
      "Such a piece of evidence!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits\n",
      "among his linen under the pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPieces of torn linen couldnât rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I\n",
      "think not, I think not, any way!â he repeated, standing in the middle\n",
      "of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about\n",
      "him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not\n",
      "forgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,\n",

      "The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the\n",
      "floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat is the matter with me!â he cried again, like one distraught.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes\n",
      "were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many\n",
      "stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because\n",
      "his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was\n",
      "clouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the\n",
      "purse too. âAh! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put\n",
      "the wet purse in my pocket!â\n",
      "\n",
      "In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were\n",
      "traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and\n",

      "a deep sigh of relief; âitâs simply the weakness of fever, a momentâs\n",
      "delirium,â and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his\n",
      "trousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the\n",
      "sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He\n",
      "flung off his boots; âtraces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with\n",
      "blood;â he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... âBut what am I\n",
      "to do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?â\n",
      "\n",
      "He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIn the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?\n",
      "But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better\n",
      "go out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,â he\n",
      "repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, âand at once, this minute,\n",
      "without lingering...â\n",
      "\n",
      "But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy\n",
      "shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to\n",
      "âgo off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that\n",
      "it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!â Several times\n",
      "he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOpen, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!â shouted\n",
      "Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. âFor whole days together\n",
      "heâs snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. Itâs\n",
      "past ten.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMaybe heâs not at home,â said a manâs voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHa! thatâs the porterâs voice.... What does he want?â\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a\n",
      "positive pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen who can have latched the door?â retorted Nastasya. âHeâs taken to\n",
      "bolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake\n",
      "up!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat do they want? Why the porter? Allâs discovered. Resist or open?\n",
      "Come what may!...â\n",
      "\n",
      "He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the\n",
      "bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and\n",
      "desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded\n",
      "paper sealed with bottle-wax.\n",
      "\n",
      "âA notice from the office,â he announced, as he gave him the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "âFrom what office?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âA summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âTo the police?... What for?...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow can I tell? Youâre sent for, so you go.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to\n",
      "go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHeâs downright ill!â observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.\n",
      "The porter turned his head for a moment. âHeâs been in a fever since\n",
      "yesterday,â she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without\n",
      "opening it. âDonât you get up then,â Nastasya went on compassionately,\n",
      "seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. âYouâre ill, and\n",
      "so donât go; thereâs no such hurry. What have you got there?â\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his\n",
      "trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep\n",
      "with them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that\n",
      "half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand\n",
      "and so fallen asleep again.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLook at the rags heâs collected and sleeps with them, as though he has\n",
      "got hold of a treasure...â\n",
      "\n",
      "And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his\n",
      "eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational\n",
      "reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that\n",
      "with a person who was going to be arrested. âBut... the police?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYouâd better have some tea! Yes? Iâll bring it, thereâs some left.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo... Iâm going; Iâll go at once,â he muttered, getting on to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, youâll never get downstairs!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, Iâll go.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAs you please.â\n",
      "\n",
      "She followed the porter out.\n",
      "\n",
      "At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,\n",
      "and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could\n",
      "distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,\n",
      "thank God!â Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began\n",
      "reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an\n",
      "ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at\n",
      "half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with\n",
      "the police! And why just to-day?â he thought in agonising bewilderment.\n",
      "âGood God, only get it over soon!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into\n",
      "laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He began, hurriedly dressing. âIf Iâm lost, I am lost, I donât care!\n",
      "Shall I put the sock on?â he suddenly wondered, âit will get dustier\n",
      "still and the traces will be gone.â\n",
      "\n",
      "But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing\n",
      "and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,\n",
      "he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs all conventional, thatâs all relative, merely a way of looking\n",
      "at it,â he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his\n",
      "mind, while he was shuddering all over, âthere, Iâve got it on! I have\n",
      "finished by getting it on!â\n",
      "\n",
      "But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, itâs too much for me...â he thought. His legs shook. âFrom fear,â\n",
      " he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. âItâs a trick! They\n",
      "want to decoy me there and confound me over everything,â he mused, as\n",
      "he went out on to the stairs--âthe worst of it is Iâm almost\n",
      "light-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...â\n",
      "\n",
      "On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as\n",
      "they were in the hole in the wall, âand very likely, itâs on purpose\n",
      "to search when Iâm out,â he thought, and stopped short. But he was\n",
      "possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call\n",
      "it, that with a wave of his hand he went on. âOnly to get it over!â\n",
      "\n",
      "In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had\n",
      "fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench\n",
      "from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish\n",
      "pedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,\n",
      "so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going\n",
      "round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the\n",
      "street on a bright sunny day.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of\n",
      "trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted\n",
      "his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf they question me, perhaps Iâll simply tell,â he thought, as he drew\n",
      "near the police-station.\n",
      "\n",
      "The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been\n",
      "moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once\n",
      "for a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,\n",
      "he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with\n",
      "a book in his hand. âA house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is\n",
      "here,â and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want\n",
      "to ask questions of anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...â he thought, as\n",
      "he reached the fourth floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The\n",
      "kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost\n",
      "the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase\n",
      "was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their\n",
      "arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of\n",
      "the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,\n",
      "too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh\n",
      "paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.\n",
      "All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him\n",
      "on and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some\n",
      "clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a\n",
      "queer-looking set. He went up to one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat is it?â\n",
      "\n",
      "He showed the notice he had received.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are a student?â the man asked, glancing at the notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, formerly a student.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a\n",
      "particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no\n",
      "interest in anything,â thought Raskolnikov.\n",
      "\n",
      "âGo in there to the head clerk,â said the clerk, pointing towards the\n",
      "furthest room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and\n",
      "packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.\n",
      "Among them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the\n",
      "table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.\n",
      "The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,\n",
      "excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a\n",
      "saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.\n",
      "Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced\n",
      "at it, said: âWait a minute,â and went on attending to the lady in\n",
      "mourning.\n",
      "\n",
      "He breathed more freely. âIt canât be that!â\n",
      "\n",
      "By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have\n",
      "courage and be calm.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSome foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!\n",
      "Hm... itâs a pity thereâs no air here,â he added, âitâs stifling.... It\n",
      "makes oneâs head dizzier than ever... and oneâs mind too...â\n",
      "\n",
      "He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing\n",
      "his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,\n",
      "something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet\n",
      "the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him\n",
      "and guess something from his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile\n",
      "face that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and\n",
      "foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,\n",
      "and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain\n",
      "on his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who\n",
      "was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLuise Ivanovna, you can sit down,â he said casually to the\n",
      "gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not\n",
      "venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIch danke,â said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank\n",
      "into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated\n",
      "about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She\n",
      "smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half\n",
      "the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was\n",
      "impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with\n",
      "some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of\n",
      "his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and\n",
      "sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her\n",
      "seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the\n",
      "officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to\n",
      "sit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He\n",
      "had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his\n",
      "face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except\n",
      "a certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at\n",
      "Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his\n",
      "humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his\n",
      "clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on\n",
      "him, so that he felt positively affronted.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat do you want?â he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged\n",
      "fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI was summoned... by a notice...â Raskolnikov faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "âFor the recovery of money due, from _the student_,â the head clerk\n",
      "interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. âHere!â and he\n",
      "flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. âRead that!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMoney? What money?â thought Raskolnikov, âbut... then... itâs certainly\n",
      "not _that_.â\n",
      "\n",
      "And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A\n",
      "load was lifted from his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?â shouted the\n",
      "assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more\n",
      "aggrieved. âYou are told to come at nine, and now itâs twelve!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,â Raskolnikov\n",
      "answered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew\n",
      "suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. âAnd itâs enough that\n",
      "I have come here ill with fever.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âKindly refrain from shouting!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâm not shouting, Iâm speaking very quietly, itâs you who are shouting\n",
      "at me. Iâm a student, and allow no one to shout at me.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he\n",
      "could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBe silent! You are in a government office. Donât be impudent, sir!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYouâre in a government office, too,â cried Raskolnikov, âand youâre\n",
      "smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect\n",
      "to all of us.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant\n",
      "superintendent was obviously disconcerted.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs not your business!â he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.\n",
      "âKindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr\n",
      "Grigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You donât pay your\n",
      "debts! Youâre a fine bird!â\n",
      "\n",
      "But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the\n",
      "paper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second\n",
      "time, and still did not understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat is this?â he asked the head clerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must\n",
      "either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written\n",
      "declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not\n",
      "to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your\n",
      "property. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed\n",
      "against you according to the law.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut I... am not in debt to anyone!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen\n",
      "roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us\n",
      "for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine\n",
      "months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.\n",
      "We therefore summon you, hereupon.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut she is my landlady!â\n",

      "âAnd what if she is your landlady?â\n",
      "\n",
      "The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,\n",
      "and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire\n",
      "for the first time--as though he would say: âWell, how do you feel now?â\n",
      " But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that\n",
      "worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he\n",
      "read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but\n",
      "all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from\n",
      "overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment\n",
      "without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions\n",
      "or surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant\n",
      "of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment\n",
      "something like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant\n",
      "superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikovâs disrespect, still fuming\n",
      "and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the\n",
      "unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in\n",
      "with an exceedingly silly smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou shameful hussy!â he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The\n",

      "think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the stepsâ edge,\n",
      "and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and\n",
      "people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed\n",
      "from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go\n",
      "down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if\n",
      "the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.\n",
      "Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if\n",
      "they had nothing to do but to watch him. âWhy is it, or can it be my\n",
      "fancy?â he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the\n",
      "Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,\n",
      "and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further\n",
      "off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,\n",
      "worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it\n",
      "before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply\n",
      "because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent\n",
      "and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way\n",
      "another idea struck him. âWhy to the Neva? Would it not be better to go\n",
      "somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things\n",
      "in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot\n",
      "perhaps?â And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea\n",
      "seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For\n",
      "coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a\n",
      "passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right\n",
      "hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far\n",
      "into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for\n",
      "twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here\n",
      "was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was\n",
      "lying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,\n",
      "apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It\n",
      "was probably a carriage builderâs or carpenterâs shed; the whole place\n",
      "from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to\n",
      "throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and\n",
      "at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where\n",
      "there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had\n",
      "been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, âStanding here\n",
      "strictly forbidden.â This was all the better, for there would be nothing\n",
      "suspicious about his going in. âHere I could throw it all in a heap and\n",
      "get away!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed\n",
      "against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn\n",
      "stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a\n",
      "street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he\n",
      "could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the\n",
      "street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,\n",
      "and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small\n",
      "hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.\n",
      "The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he\n",
      "seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was\n",
      "in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But\n",
      "he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.\n",
      "Nothing could be noticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,\n",
      "almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in\n",
      "the police-office. âI have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of\n",
      "looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since\n",
      "the house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were\n",
      "found, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!â And he laughed.\n",
      "Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless\n",
      "laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But\n",
      "when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come\n",
      "upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his\n",
      "mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat\n",
      "on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it\n",
      "would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had\n",
      "given the twenty copecks: âDamn him!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now\n",
      "seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there\n",
      "really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that\n",
      "point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDamn it all!â he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.\n",
      "âIf it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how\n",
      "stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned\n",
      "upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I\n",
      "care for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It\n",
      "is not that at all!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple\n",
      "question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if\n",
      "I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even\n",
      "glance into the purse and donât know what I had there, for which I have\n",
      "undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,\n",
      "filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the\n",
      "water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen\n",
      "either... howâs that?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and\n",
      "it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night\n",
      "without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though\n",
      "it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and\n",
      "understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the\n",
      "moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out\n",
      "of it.... Yes, so it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is because I am very ill,â he decided grimly at last, âI have been\n",
      "worrying and fretting myself, and I donât know what I am doing....\n",
      "Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been\n",
      "worrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what\n",
      "if I donât get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some\n",
      "distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new\n",
      "overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him\n",
      "every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for\n",
      "everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.\n",
      "All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their\n",
      "movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he\n",
      "might have spat at him or bitten him....\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near\n",
      "the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. âWhy, he lives here, in that house,â\n",
      " he thought, âwhy, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here\n",
      "itâs the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;\n",
      "have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never\n",
      "mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the\n",
      "day _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further\n",
      "now.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He went up to Razumihinâs room on the fifth floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and\n",
      "he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each\n",
      "other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on\n",
      "his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs it you?â he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a\n",
      "brief pause, he whistled. âAs hard up as all that! Why, brother, youâve\n",
      "cut me out!â he added, looking at Raskolnikovâs rags. âCome sit down,\n",
      "you are tired, Iâll be bound.â\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was\n",
      "in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his\n",
      "visitor was ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, you are seriously ill, do you know that?â He began feeling his\n",
      "pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNever mind,â he said, âI have come for this: I have no lessons.... I\n",
      "wanted,... but I donât really want lessons....â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut I say! You are delirious, you know!â Razumihin observed, watching\n",
      "him carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, I am not.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to\n",
      "Razumihinâs, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend\n",
      "face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all\n",
      "disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the\n",
      "wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at\n",
      "himself as soon as he crossed Razumihinâs threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "âGood-bye,â he said abruptly, and walked to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "âStop, stop! You queer fish.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât want to,â said the other, again pulling away his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this\n",

      "\n",
      "âWell, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could\n",

      "mean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?\n",
      "Nothing at all... no oneâs services... no oneâs sympathy. I am by\n",

      "thereâs a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.\n",
      "I would not exchange him for five lessons. Heâs doing publishing of a\n",
      "kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they\n",
      "have! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I\n",
      "was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!\n",
      "Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of\n",
      "anything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of\n",
      "the German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses\n",
      "the question, âIs woman a human being?â And, of course, triumphantly\n",
      "proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a\n",
      "contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand\n",
      "these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous\n",
      "title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He\n",
      "pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles\n",
      "for the job, and Iâve had six already in advance. When we have finished\n",
      "this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of\n",
      "the dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have\n",
      "marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was\n",
      "a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I donât contradict him, hang him!\n",
      "Well, would you like to do the second signature of â_Is woman a human\n",
      "being?_â If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those\n",
      "are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in\n",
      "advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.\n",

      "The only comfort is, that itâs bound to be a change for the better.\n",

      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles\n",

      "But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky\n",

      "a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under\n",
      "his horsesâ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the\n",
      "railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle\n",

      "But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered\n",
      "after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt\n",
      "someone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman\n",
      "in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter,\n",
      "wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.\n",

      "his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar\n",
      "asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he\n",
      "doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and\n",
      "turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without\n",
      "a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the\n",
      "Neva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the\n",
      "bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,\n",
      "and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.\n",
      "The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one\n",
      "uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood\n",
      "still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was\n",
      "especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had\n",
      "hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,\n",
      "gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at\n",
      "a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely\n",
      "cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered\n",
      "every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting\n",
      "himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled\n",
      "those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was\n",
      "no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and\n",
      "grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,\n",
      "as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be\n",
      "interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...\n",
      "so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his\n",
      "heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him\n",
      "now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,\n",
      "his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He\n",
      "felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing\n",
      "from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he\n",
      "suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his\n",
      "hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into\n",
      "the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut\n",
      "himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been\n",
      "walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.\n",
      "Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the\n",
      "sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....\n",
      "\n",
      "It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a\n",
      "scream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,\n",
      "blows and curses he had never heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he\n",
      "sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing\n",
      "and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement\n",
      "he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and\n",
      "wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make\n",
      "out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be\n",
      "beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of\n",
      "her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost\n",
      "a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly\n",
      "and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov\n",
      "trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.\n",
      "Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,\n",
      "banging her head against the steps--thatâs clear, that can be told\n",
      "from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world\n",
      "topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys\n",
      "and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors\n",
      "banging. âBut why, why, and how could it be?â he repeated, thinking\n",
      "seriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And\n",
      "they would come to him then next, âfor no doubt... itâs all about\n",
      "that... about yesterday.... Good God!â He would have fastened his door\n",
      "with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would\n",
      "be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed\n",
      "him.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,\n",
      "began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya\n",

      "they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked\n",

      "Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the\n",

      "earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective\n",
      "means towards his friendâs recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made\n",
      "no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa\n",
      "without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but\n",
      "even perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost\n",
      "animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying\n",
      "low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession\n",
      "of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.\n",
      "Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen\n",
      "spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away\n",
      "capriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real\n",
      "pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed\n",

      "How I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had\n",

      "and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last\n",

      "\n",
      "There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitchâs being offended this time,\n",
      "but he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all\n",

      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he\n",
      "answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as\n",
      "though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something\n",
      "new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at\n",
      "him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitchâs whole\n",
      "appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of âfiancÃ©â so\n",
      "unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far\n",
      "too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few\n",
      "days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation\n",
      "of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,\n",
      "indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the\n",
      "agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such\n",
      "circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rÃ´le of\n",
      "fiancÃ©. All his clothes were fresh from the tailorâs and were all\n",
      "right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even\n",
      "the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch\n",
      "treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The\n",
      "exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,\n",
      "if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in\n",
      "his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr\n",
      "Petrovitchâs attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,\n",
      "light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a\n",
      "cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best\n",
      "of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even\n",
      "handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.\n",
      "His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,\n",
      "growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,\n",
      "touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled\n",
      "at a hairdresserâs, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair\n",
      "usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.\n",
      "If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather\n",
      "good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other\n",
      "causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled\n",
      "malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no\n",
      "notice of their oddities.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,â he began,\n",
      "again breaking the silence with an effort. âIf I had been aware of your\n",
      "illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I\n",
      "have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention\n",
      "other preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your\n",
      "mamma and sister any minute.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed\n",
      "some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing\n",
      "followed, he went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "â... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhere?â asked Raskolnikov weakly.\n",

      "\n",
      "âThatâs in Voskresensky,â put in Razumihin. âThere are two storeys of\n",

      "\n",
      "âI could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger\n",
      "in Petersburg myself,â Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. âHowever, the\n",
      "two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...\n",
      "I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,â he said,\n",
      "addressing Raskolnikov, âand I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am\n",
      "myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me\n",
      "of Bakaleyevâs house, too...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âLebeziatnikov?â said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.\n",

      "âYes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you\n",
      "know him?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes... no,â Raskolnikov answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "âExcuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....\n",
      "A very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one\n",

      "\n",
      "âHow do you mean?â asked Razumihin.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIn the most serious and essential matters,â Pyotr Petrovitch replied,\n",
      "as though delighted at the question. âYou see, itâs ten years since I\n",
      "visited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in\n",
      "the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.\n",
      "And itâs my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the\n",
      "younger generation. And I confess I am delighted...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAt what?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYour question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find\n",
      "clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs true,â Zossimov let drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNonsense! Thereâs no practicality.â Razumihin flew at him.\n",
      "âPracticality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from\n",
      "heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from\n",
      "all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,â he said to\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch, âand desire for good exists, though itâs in a childish\n",
      "form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.\n",
      "Anyway, thereâs no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât agree with you,â Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident\n",
      "enjoyment. âOf course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,\n",
      "but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of\n",
      "enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little\n",
      "has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.\n",
      "Itâs my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been\n",

      "the time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure\n",

      "swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning\n",

      "first turning he stopped and, after a minuteâs thought, turned into a\n",
      "side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any\n",
      "object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking\n",
      "at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted\n",
      "his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.\n",
      "He had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.\n",
      "An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the\n",
      "house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the\n",
      "right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.\n",
      "The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing\n",
      "and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework\n",
      "of the window had been taken out. âThat wasnât so then,â he thought.\n",
      "Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been\n",
      "working. âItâs shut up and the door newly painted. So itâs to let.â Then\n",
      "the third storey and the fourth. âHere!â He was perplexed to find the\n",
      "door of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;\n",
      "he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last\n",
      "stairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were\n",
      "workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he\n",
      "would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the\n",
      "same places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed\n",
      "strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There\n",
      "were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the\n",
      "other. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with\n",
      "lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for\n",
      "some reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper\n",
      "with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.\n",
      "The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were\n",
      "hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took\n",

      "A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One\n",
      "of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying\n",

      "âWhat a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last\n",
      "in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a\n",
      "man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with\n",
      "blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was\n",
      "flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and\n",
      "disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMerciful heaven!â wailed the coachman, âwhat more could I do? If Iâd\n",
      "been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,\n",
      "not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody\n",
      "else. A drunken man canât walk straight, we all know.... I saw him\n",
      "crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again\n",
      "and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell\n",
      "straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very\n",

      "\n",
      "âJust here, three houses away,â he said eagerly, âthe house belongs to\n",

      "behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of âthey are at it\n",
      "againâ was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you\n",

      "deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth\n",
      "and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising\n",

      "long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in\n",

      "wondering childish eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "âA-ah,â he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.\n",

      "him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully\n",
      "felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the\n",
      "blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured manâs chest. It was gashed,\n",
      "crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.\n",
      "On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking\n",
      "yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horseâs hoof. The doctor\n",
      "frowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and\n",
      "turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,â the doctor\n",

      "At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,\n",
      "and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing\n",
      "the sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.\n",
      "The doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.\n",
      "Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his\n",
      "shoulders and remained.\n",
      "\n",
      "All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably\n",
      "understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt\n",
      "down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of\n",
      "her. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his\n",
      "little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with\n",
      "precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which\n",
      "seemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her\n",
      "lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling\n",
      "straight the boyâs shirt, and managed to cover the girlâs bare shoulders\n",
      "with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her\n",
      "knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was\n",
      "opened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from\n",
      "all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not\n",
      "venture beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She\n",
      "came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for\n",
      "her mother, went up to her and said, âSheâs coming, I met her in the\n",
      "street.â Her mother made her kneel beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,\n",
      "and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,\n",
      "death and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of\n",
      "the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,\n",
      "unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the\n",
      "doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.\n",
      "She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with\n",
      "its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the\n",
      "whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought\n",
      "with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat\n",
      "with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat\n",
      "was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in\n",
      "terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather\n",
      "pretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the\n",
      "priest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some\n",
      "words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a\n",
      "step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.\n",
      "The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and\n",
      "consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat am I to do with these?â she interrupted sharply and irritably,\n",
      "pointing to the little ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "âGod is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,â the priest began.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAch! He is merciful, but not to us.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs a sin, a sin, madam,â observed the priest, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd isnât that a sin?â cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying\n",
      "man.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPerhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to\n",
      "compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou donât understand!â cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.\n",
      "âAnd why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself\n",
      "under the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.\n",
      "He drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he\n",
      "wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God heâs dying! One\n",
      "less to keep!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou must forgive in the hour of death, thatâs a sin, madam, such\n",
      "feelings are a great sin.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,\n",
      "wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,\n",
      "and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now\n",
      "she flew at him almost in a frenzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh, father! Thatâs words and only words! Forgive! If heâd not been run\n",
      "over, heâd have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and\n",
      "in rags and heâd have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been\n",
      "sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the childrenâs\n",
      "and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I\n",
      "should have been darning them. Thatâs how I spend my nights!... Whatâs\n",
      "the use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!â\n",
      "\n",
      "A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief\n",
      "to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her\n",
      "aching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed\n",
      "his head and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face\n",
      "of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying\n",
      "to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and\n",
      "articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he\n",
      "wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "âBe silent! No need! I know what you want to say!â And the sick man\n",
      "was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the\n",
      "doorway and he saw Sonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a\n",
      "corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhoâs that? Whoâs that?â he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,\n",
      "in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his\n",
      "daughter was standing, and trying to sit up.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLie down! Lie do-own!â cried Katerina Ivanovna.\n",
      "\n",
      "With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his\n",
      "elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as\n",
      "though not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.\n",
      "Suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and\n",
      "gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying\n",
      "father. His face showed intense suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSonia! Daughter! Forgive!â he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand\n",
      "to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on\n",
      "the floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he\n",
      "was dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so\n",
      "without moving. He died in her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHeâs got what he wanted,â Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husbandâs\n",
      "dead body. âWell, whatâs to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can\n",
      "I give them to-morrow to eat?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\n",
      "\n",
      "âKaterina Ivanovna,â he began, âlast week your husband told me all his\n",
      "life and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate\n",
      "reverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you\n",
      "all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,\n",
      "in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became\n",
      "friends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my\n",
      "dead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any\n",
      "assistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will\n",
      "be sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....\n",
      "Good-bye!â\n",
      "\n",
      "And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd\n",
      "to the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim\n",
      "Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions\n",
      "in person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but\n",
      "Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh, is that you?â he asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHeâs dead,â answered Raskolnikov. âThe doctor and the priest have been,\n",
      "all as it should have been. Donât worry the poor woman too much, she is\n",
      "in consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a\n",
      "kind-hearted man, I know...â he added with a smile, looking straight in\n",
      "his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut you are spattered with blood,â observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing\n",
      "in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikovâs waistcoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes... Iâm covered with blood,â Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;\n",
      "then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious\n",
      "of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and\n",
      "strength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be\n",
      "compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been\n",
      "pardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on\n",
      "his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting\n",
      "with him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid\n",
      "footsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was\n",
      "running after him, calling âWait! wait!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped\n",
      "short a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov\n",
      "could distinguish the childâs thin but pretty little face, looking at\n",
      "him with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message\n",
      "which she was evidently glad to give.\n",
      "\n",
      "âTell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?â she said\n",
      "hurriedly in a breathless voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of\n",
      "rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said\n",
      "why.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWho sent you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSister Sonia sent me,â answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI knew it was sister Sonia sent you.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,\n",
      "too, and said âRun fast, Polenka.ââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo you love sister Sonia?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI love her more than anyone,â Polenka answered with a peculiar\n",
      "earnestness, and her smile became graver.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd will you love me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "By way of answer he saw the little girlâs face approaching him, her full\n",
      "lips naÃ¯vely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks\n",
      "held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl\n",
      "wept softly, pressing her face against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am sorry for father,â she said a moment later, raising her\n",
      "tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. âItâs\n",
      "nothing but misfortunes now,â she added suddenly with that peculiarly\n",
      "sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak\n",
      "like grown-up people.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDid your father love you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe loved Lida most,â she went on very seriously without a smile,\n",
      "exactly like grown-up people, âhe loved her because she is little and\n",
      "because she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But\n",
      "he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,â she added with\n",
      "dignity. âAnd mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she\n",
      "liked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,\n",
      "for itâs time my education began.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd do you know your prayers?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself\n",
      "as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.\n",
      "First they repeat the âAve Mariaâ and then another prayer: âLord,\n",
      "forgive and bless sister Sonia,â and then another, âLord, forgive and\n",
      "bless our second father.â For our elder father is dead and this is\n",
      "another one, but we do pray for the other as well.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âPolenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. âAnd Thy\n",

      "\n",
      "âIâll pray for you all the rest of my life,â the little girl declared\n",

      "warmly once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to\n",

      "unlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised\n",
      "clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly\n",
      "unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and\n",

      "Who had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as\n",

      "And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.\n",
      "He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and\n",
      "looked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening\n",
      "attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her\n",
      "arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,\n",
      "without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to\n",
      "what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a\n",
      "white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of\n",
      "extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed\n",
      "like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps\n",
      "just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery\n",
      "of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be\n",

      "he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might\n",

      "me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that\n",

      "queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have\n",
      "had some good qualities or itâs quite inexplicable.... She had no money\n",

      "Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to\n",
      "the latterâs annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently\n",
      "caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in\n",
      "detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly\n",
      "blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not\n",
      "seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.\n",

      "from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna\n",
      "has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so\n",
      "rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...\n",

      "announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you\n",

      "in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with\n",
      "you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of\n",
      "delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you\n",
      "are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have\n",
      "the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings\n",
      "not later than to-morrow evening at eight oâclock precisely, and\n",
      "herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative\n",
      "request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as\n",
      "he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my\n",
      "visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire\n",
      "from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation\n",
      "upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own\n",
      "interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,\n",
      "that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be\n",
      "compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to\n",

      "ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able\n",
      "to leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief\n",
      "by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who\n",
      "was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of\n",
      "notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the\n",

      "a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin\n",
      "Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her\n",
      "dress. âA present from her _fiancÃ©_,â thought Razumihin.\n",

      "gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in\n",
      "people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently\n",

      "\n",
      "He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place\n",
      "as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,\n",
      "fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for\n",
      "some time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed\n",
      "to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the\n",
      "day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like\n",
      "a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.\n",
      "His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke\n",
      "little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a\n",
      "restlessness in his movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete\n",
      "the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The\n",
      "pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister\n",
      "entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in\n",
      "place of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look\n",
      "of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient\n",
      "with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed\n",
      "in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of\n",
      "bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable\n",
      "torture. He saw later that almost every word of the following\n",
      "conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But\n",
      "at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself\n",
      "and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a\n",
      "monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, I see myself now that I am almost well,â said Raskolnikov,\n",

      "up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. âIn another three or\n",
      "four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,\n",
      "as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been\n",
      "coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been\n",

      "with him after three yearsâ absence, this intimate tone of conversation,\n",
      "in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,\n",
      "would have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent\n",
      "matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had\n",

      "and found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am\n",
      "sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at\n",
      "all. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for\n",
      "me. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to\n",

      "âAnd why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are\n",

      "Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It\n",

      "\n",
      "He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for\n",

      "plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I\n",
      "am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon\n",

      "little child. She was even about to retreat. âOh... itâs you!â said\n",

      "of âsome young woman of notorious behaviour.â He had only just been\n",
      "protesting against Luzhinâs calumny and declaring that he had seen the\n",

      "notorious behaviour.â All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through\n",
      "his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated\n",

      "She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who\n",

      "still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,\n",
      "started on hearing Soniaâs words: âand I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov\n",
      "lived?â He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially\n",
      "upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted\n",
      "the house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not\n",
      "to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for\n",
      "something. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and\n",
      "that Sonia was going home.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHome? Where? Iâve seen that face somewhere,â he thought. âI must find\n",
      "out.â\n",
      "\n",
      "At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the\n",
      "same way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on\n",
      "the other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook\n",
      "her and kept two or three yards behind her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high\n",
      "shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore\n",
      "good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.\n",
      "He carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each\n",
      "step; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face\n",
      "with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.\n",
      "His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with\n",
      "grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.\n",
      "His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were\n",
      "crimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger\n",
      "than his years.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on\n",
      "the pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching\n",
      "the house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed\n",
      "her, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right\n",
      "corner. âBah!â muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs\n",
      "behind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,\n",
      "turned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed\n",
      "in chalk, âKapernaumov, Tailor.â âBah!â the stranger repeated again,\n",
      "wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.\n",
      "The doors were two or three yards apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou lodge at Kapernaumovâs,â he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.\n",
      "âHe altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at\n",
      "Madame Resslichâs. How odd!â Sonia looked at him attentively.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWe are neighbours,â he went on gaily. âI only came to town the day\n",
      "before yesterday. Good-bye for the present.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for\n",

      "On the way to Porfiryâs, Razumihin was obviously excited.\n",

      "am glad!â\n",

      "days before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem\n",
      "the things now,â he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous\n",
      "solicitude about the things. âIâve not more than a silver rouble\n",
      "left... after last nightâs accursed delirium!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid special emphasis on the delirium.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, yes,â Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. âThen\n",
      "thatâs why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you\n",
      "were continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... thatâs\n",
      "clear, itâs all clear now.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will\n",
      "go to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared\n",
      "up_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have\n",
      "on all of them!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âShall we find him?â he asked suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, yes,â Razumihin answered quickly. âHe is a nice fellow, you will\n",
      "see, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished\n",
      "manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent\n",
      "fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He\n",
      "is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or\n",
      "rather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....\n",
      "But he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a\n",
      "case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very\n",
      "anxious to make your acquaintance!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOn what grounds is he so anxious?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, itâs not exactly... you see, since youâve been ill I happen to have\n",
      "mentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... about\n",
      "your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,\n",
      "âWhat a pity!â And so I concluded... from everything together, not only\n",
      "that; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on\n",
      "the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,\n",
      "of your exaggerating it, you see.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right,â he said\n",
      "with a constrained smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there was\n",
      "something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!â Raskolnikov cried\n",
      "with exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. Oneâs ashamed\n",

      "âIf you are ashamed, then donât speak of it.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov\n",

      "\n",
      "âI shall have to pull a long face with him too,â he thought, with a\n",
      "beating heart, and he turned white, âand do it naturally, too. But the\n",
      "most natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing\n",
      "at all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we\n",
      "shall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good\n",

      "in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be\n",
      "writhing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you\n",
      "were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even\n",

      "\n",
      "âYou were inquiring for me... of the porter?â Raskolnikov said at last,\n",

      "meaning of it?â\n",

      "Raskolnikov.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMurderer!â he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a\n",
      "cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for\n",
      "a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So\n",
      "they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man did not look at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?â muttered\n",

      "\n",
      "â_You_ are a murderer,â the man answered still more articulately and\n",
      "emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked\n",
      "straight into Raskolnikovâs pale face and stricken eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left\n",
      "without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after\n",
      "him. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still\n",
      "standing there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that\n",
      "he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way\n",
      "back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap\n",
      "and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.\n",
      "Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he\n",
      "stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some\n",
      "images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of\n",
      "people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would\n",
      "never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table\n",
      "in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars\n",
      "in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite\n",
      "dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the\n",
      "Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one\n",
      "another, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried\n",
      "to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression\n",
      "within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even\n",
      "pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too\n",
      "was an almost pleasant sensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and\n",
      "pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some\n",
      "time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into\n",
      "the room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasyaâs\n",
      "whisper:\n",
      "\n",
      "âDonât disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âQuite so,â answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the\n",
      "door. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on\n",
      "his back again, clasping his hands behind his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWho is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,\n",
      "what did he see? He has seen it all, thatâs clear. Where was he then?\n",
      "And from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?\n",
      "And how could he see? Is it possible? Hm...â continued Raskolnikov,\n",
      "turning cold and shivering, âand the jewel case Nikolay found behind the\n",
      "door--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you\n",
      "can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it\n",
      "possible?â He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he\n",
      "had become. âI ought to have known it,â he thought with a bitter smile.\n",
      "âAnd how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an\n",
      "axe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did\n",
      "know!â he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some\n",
      "thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is\n",
      "permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in\n",
      "Egypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off\n",
      "with a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and\n",

      "\n",
      "One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the\n",

      "a red trunk under her bed--itâs a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to\n",
      "digest! How can they digest it! Itâs too inartistic. âA Napoleon creep\n",
      "under an old womanâs bed! Ugh, how loathsome!â\n",
      "\n",
      "At moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish\n",
      "excitement. âThe old woman is of no consequence,â he thought, hotly and\n",
      "incoherently. âThe old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not\n",
      "what matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to\n",
      "overstep.... I didnât kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the\n",
      "principle, but I didnât overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was\n",
      "only capable of killing. And it seems I wasnât even capable of that...\n",
      "Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are\n",
      "industrious, commercial people; âthe happiness of allâ is their case.\n",
      "No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I\n",
      "donât want to wait for âthe happiness of all.â I want to live myself,\n",
      "or else better not live at all. I simply couldnât pass by my mother\n",
      "starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the\n",
      "âhappiness of all.â I am putting my little brick into the happiness of\n",
      "all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only\n",
      "live once, I too want.... Ech, I am an Ã¦sthetic louse and nothing\n",
      "more,â he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. âYes, I am certainly a\n",
      "louse,â he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing\n",
      "with it with vindictive pleasure. âIn the first place, because I can\n",
      "reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been\n",
      "troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for\n",
      "my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble\n",
      "object--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as\n",
      "possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked\n",
      "out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I\n",
      "needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone\n",
      "to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I\n",
      "am utterly a louse,â he added, grinding his teeth, âis that I am\n",
      "perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt\n",
      "beforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can\n",
      "anything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The\n",
      "abjectness! I understand the âprophetâ with his sabre, on his steed:\n",

      "and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a\n",
      "peculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the\n",
      "street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other\n",
      "people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and\n",
      "stagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was\n",
      "distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do\n",
      "something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he\n",
      "stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,\n",
      "beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and\n",
      "walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to\n",
      "him. âStay, did he really beckon?â Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried\n",
      "to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and\n",
      "was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long\n",
      "coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;\n",
      "they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. âDoes he\n",
      "know I am following him?â thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the\n",
      "gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in\n",
      "to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard\n",
      "the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at\n",
      "once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have\n",
      "gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard\n",
      "slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely\n",
      "familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone\n",
      "through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he\n",
      "reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were\n",
      "at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps\n",
      "of the man above had died away. âSo he must have stopped or hidden\n",
      "somewhere.â He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a\n",
      "stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own\n",
      "footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be\n",
      "hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he\n",
      "hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as\n",
      "though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour\n",
      "which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the\n",
      "chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the\n",
      "frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.\n",
      "âItâs the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,â thought\n",
      "Raskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more\n",
      "silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was\n",
      "painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp\n",
      "crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly\n",
      "flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At\n",
      "that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little\n",
      "cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. âWhy is that cloak\n",
      "here?â he thought, âit wasnât there before....â He went up to it quietly\n",
      "and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved\n",
      "the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent\n",
      "double so that he couldnât see her face; but it was she. He stood over\n",
      "her. âShe is afraid,â he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the\n",
      "noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange\n",
      "to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was\n",
      "frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,\n",
      "bent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up\n",
      "into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old\n",
      "woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing\n",
      "her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door\n",
      "from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and\n",
      "whispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the\n",
      "old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe\n",
      "the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old\n",
      "woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the\n",
      "passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the\n",
      "landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of\n",
      "heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.\n",
      "Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they\n",
      "would not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:\n",
      "his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the\n",
      "doorway watching him intently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them\n",
      "again. He lay on his back without stirring.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs it still a dream?â he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly\n",
      "perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after\n",
      "him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on\n",
      "Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he\n",
      "put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane\n",
      "and his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait\n",
      "indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen\n",
      "glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost\n",
      "whitish beard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There\n",
      "was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.\n",
      "Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was\n",
      "unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.\n",

      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia\n",
      "lived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the\n",
      "porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of\n",
      "Kapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard\n",
      "the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second\n",
      "floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey\n",
      "over the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where\n",
      "to turn for Kapernaumovâs door, a door opened three paces from him; he\n",
      "mechanically took hold of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWho is there?â a womanâs voice asked uneasily.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs I... come to see you,â answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the\n",
      "tiny entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs you! Good heavens!â cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to\n",
      "the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhich is your room? This way?â and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at\n",
      "her, hastened in.\n",
      "\n",
      "A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the\n",
      "candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly\n",
      "agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour\n",
      "rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She\n",
      "felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly\n",
      "and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the\n",
      "Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.\n",
      "In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always\n",
      "kept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.\n",
      "Soniaâs room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and\n",
      "this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking\n",
      "out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute\n",
      "angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.\n",
      "The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any\n",
      "furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,\n",
      "beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a\n",
      "blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other\n",
      "flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite\n",
      "wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers\n",
      "looking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the\n",
      "room. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the\n",
      "corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There\n",
      "was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and\n",
      "unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble\n",
      "with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter\n",
      "of her destinies.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am late.... Itâs eleven, isnât it?â he asked, still not lifting his\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes,â muttered Sonia, âoh yes, it is,â she added, hastily, as though in\n",
      "that lay her means of escape. âMy landladyâs clock has just struck... I\n",
      "heard it myself....â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâve come to you for the last time,â Raskolnikov went on gloomily,\n",
      "although this was the first time. âI may perhaps not see you again...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAre you... going away?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât know... to-morrow....â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?â Soniaâs voice\n",
      "shook.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: Iâve\n",
      "come to say one word....â\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was\n",
      "sitting down while she was all the while standing before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy are you standing? Sit down,â he said in a changed voice, gentle and\n",
      "friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI have always been like that,â she said.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âYes.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course, you were,â he added abruptly and the expression of his face\n",
      "and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked round him once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes....â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThey live there, through that door?â\n",

      "\n",
      "âYes.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI should be afraid in your room at night,â he observed gloomily.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThey are very good people, very kind,â answered Sonia, who still seemed\n",
      "bewildered, âand all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.\n",
      "And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThey all stammer, donât they?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes.... He stammers and heâs lame. And his wife, too.... Itâs not\n",
      "exactly that she stammers, but she canât speak plainly. She is a very\n",
      "kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven\n",
      "children... and itâs only the eldest one that stammers and the others\n",
      "are simply ill... but they donât stammer.... But where did you hear\n",
      "about them?â she added with some surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYour father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how you\n",
      "went out at six oâclock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna\n",
      "knelt down by your bed.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia was confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI fancied I saw him to-day,â she whispered hesitatingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhom?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âFather. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten\n",
      "oâclock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I\n",
      "wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou were walking in the streets?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes,â Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and\n",
      "looking down.\n",
      "\n",
      "âKaterina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh no, what are you saying? No!â Sonia looked at him almost with\n",
      "dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou love her, then?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âLove her? Of course!â said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she\n",
      "clasped her hands in distress. âAh, you donât.... If you only knew!\n",
      "You see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, you\n",
      "see... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how\n",
      "kind! Ah, you donât understand, you donât understand!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement\n",
      "and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in\n",
      "her eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that\n",
      "she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort\n",
      "of _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in\n",
      "every feature of her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBeat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,\n",
      "what then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so\n",
      "unhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,\n",
      "she is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness\n",
      "everywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she\n",
      "wouldnât do wrong. She doesnât see that itâs impossible for people to\n",
      "be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is\n",
      "good!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd what will happen to you?â\n",
      "\n",

      "âThey are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands\n",
      "before, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,\n",
      "how will it be now?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât know,â Sonia articulated mournfully.\n",

      "\n",
      "âI donât know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,\n",

      "Ivanovna says that she wonât stay another minute.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, no, donât talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.â Sonia\n",
      "was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other\n",
      "little bird were to be angry. âAnd what could she do? What, what could\n",
      "she do?â she persisted, getting hot and excited. âAnd how she cried\n",
      "to-day! Her mind is unhinged, havenât you noticed it? At one minute she\n",
      "is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the\n",
      "lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,\n",
      "weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the\n",
      "wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her\n",
      "hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will\n",
      "borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and\n",
      "set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to\n",
      "superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses\n",
      "and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in\n",
      "her fancies! One canât contradict her. And all the day long she has been\n",
      "washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with\n",
      "her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this\n",
      "morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are\n",
      "quite worn out. Only the money weâd reckoned wasnât enough, not nearly\n",
      "enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,\n",
      "you donât know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the\n",
      "shopmen because she hadnât enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her....â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, after that I can understand your living like this,â Raskolnikov\n",
      "said with a bitter smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd arenât you sorry for them? Arenât you sorry?â Sonia flew at him\n",
      "again. âWhy, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though youâd\n",
      "seen nothing of it, and if youâd seen everything, oh dear! And how\n",
      "often, how often Iâve brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only\n",
      "a week before his death. I was cruel! And how often Iâve done it! Ah,\n",
      "Iâve been wretched at the thought of it all day!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou were cruel?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, I--I. I went to see them,â she went on, weeping, âand father said,\n",

      "had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives\n",
      "there, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, âI\n",
      "canât stay,â as I didnât want to read, and Iâd gone in chiefly to show\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some\n",
      "collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina\n",

      "in the glass and was delighted with them. âMake me a present of them,\n",

      "so much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old\n",
      "happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she\n",
      "has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasnât had all these years!\n",
      "And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, sheâd sooner give\n",
      "away everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I\n",
      "was sorry to give them. âWhat use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?â I\n",
      "said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave\n",
      "me such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.\n",
      "And it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,\n",
      "but for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,\n",

      "\n",

      "be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head\n",
      "against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....\n",

      "of malignance, laughed and looked at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soniaâs face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at\n",
      "him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not\n",

      "\n",
      "âYou say Katerina Ivanovnaâs mind is unhinged; your own mind is\n",
      "unhinged,â he said after a brief silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not\n",
      "looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put\n",
      "his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful\n",
      "face. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were\n",
      "twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the\n",
      "ground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And\n",
      "certainly he looked like a madman.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat are you doing to me?â she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden\n",
      "anguish clutched at her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood up at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of\n",
      "humanity,â he said wildly and walked away to the window. âListen,â he\n",
      "added, turning to her a minute later. âI said just now to an insolent\n",

      "seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.\n",

      "\n",
      "âIt was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka,â Nikolay replied\n",
      "hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.\n",

      "âI knew it!â cried Porfiry, with vexation. âItâs not his own tale he is\n",
      "telling,â he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested\n",
      "on Raskolnikov again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had\n",

      "And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI suppose you didnât expect it?â said Raskolnikov who, though he had\n",

      "\n",
      "âAnd your little surprise, arenât you going to show it to me?â\n",

      "\n",
      "As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people\n",
      "were looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,\n",
      "whom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there\n",
      "waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running\n",
      "after him, out of breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOne word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, itâs in Godâs hands,\n",

      "again. If itâs Godâs will, we may see a great deal of one another.â\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âYes; know each other through and through,â assented Porfiry Petrovitch,\n",

      "success, but your office is such a comical one.â\n",
      "\n",

      "prick up his ears at this.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay\n",
      "psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have\n",
      "been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and\n",
      "now that he has confessed, youâll begin vivisecting him again. âYou are\n",
      "lying,â youâll say. âYou are not the murderer! You canât be! Itâs not\n",
      "your own tale you are telling!â You must admit itâs a comical business!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was\n",

      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that\n",
      "on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to\n",
      "collect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he\n",
      "was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,\n",
      "amazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolayâs confession\n",
      "was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at\n",
      "once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they\n",
      "would be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do\n",
      "something for himself, for the danger was imminent.\n",

      "better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiryâs âleadâ had been for\n",
      "him. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,\n",
      "circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first\n",
      "glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was\n",
      "bound to win. Thereâs no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised\n",
      "himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was\n",
      "nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasnât\n",

      "\n",
      "He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in\n",
      "his hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his\n",

      "\n",
      "He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might\n",

      "and there at once he would see Sonia.\n",

      "suddenly appeared a figure--yesterdayâs visitor _from underground_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,\n",
      "and took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as\n",
      "yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change\n",
      "in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put\n",
      "his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have\n",
      "looked exactly like a peasant woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat do you want?â asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man was\n",

      "\n",
      "âWhat is it?â cried Raskolnikov.\n",

      "you....â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWho came?â Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.\n",

      "He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the\n",
      "police-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even\n",
      "now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round\n",
      "and made him some answer....\n",
      "\n",
      "So this was the solution of yesterdayâs horror. The most awful thought\n",
      "was that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself\n",
      "on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell\n",
      "nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So\n",

      "Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept\n",
      "as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before\n",
      "fantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been\n",
      "gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch\n",
      "immediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had\n",

      "late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the\n",

      "That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his\n",
      "young friendâs account. He had set down a good many points against him\n",
      "of late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to\n",
      "have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterdayâs interview.\n",
      "That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness\n",
      "and irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness\n",
      "followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case\n",
      "in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat\n",
      "which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being\n",
      "redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,\n",
      "would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just\n",
      "been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr\n",
      "Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In\n",
      "the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the\n",
      "instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the\n",
      "flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAm I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?â Pyotr\n",
      "Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a\n",
      "gleam of desperate hope. âCan all that be really so irrevocably over?\n",
      "Is it no use to make another effort?â The thought of Dounia sent a\n",
      "voluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,\n",
      "and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,â he thought, as\n",
      "he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikovâs room, âand why on earth was I\n",
      "such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny\n",
      "so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!\n",
      "foo! If Iâd spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau\n",
      "and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and\n",
      "all that sort of trash from Knoppâs and the English shop, my position\n",
      "would have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me\n",
      "so easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return\n",
      "money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to\n",
      "do it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man\n",

      "was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most\n",
      "important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with\n",
      "great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was\n",
      "very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;\n",
      "she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she\n",
      "was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he\n",
      "went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikovâs, somewhat thoughtful. He\n",
      "had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay\n",
      "with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He\n",
      "had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from\n",
      "parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard\n",
      "of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young\n",
      "progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting\n",
      "circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had\n",
      "impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who\n",
      "despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a\n",
      "peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form\n",
      "even an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had\n",
      "heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some\n",
      "sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and\n",
      "distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for\n",
      "many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown\n",
      "up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the\n",
      "thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of\n",
      "this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,\n",
      "when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases\n",
      "in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,\n",
      "had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal\n",
      "for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious\n",
      "trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the\n",
      "subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to\n",
      "anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of âour younger\n",
      "generation.â He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before\n",
      "his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current\n",
      "phrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace\n",
      "simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he\n",
      "had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it\n",
      "would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the\n",
      "systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for\n",
      "him. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what\n",

      "to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what\n",
      "precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up\n",
      "to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the\n",

      "soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in\n",
      "speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.\n",
      "He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did\n",
      "not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch\n",
      "really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress\n",
      "and âour younger generationâ from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous\n",

      "listen too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun\n",
      "instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace\n",
      "simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of\n",
      "any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up\n",
      "third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own\n",

      "Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own\n",
      "heart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort\n",
      "of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal\n",
      "feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,\n",
      "especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview\n",
      "with Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the\n",
      "terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the\n",
      "thought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovnaâs, âWell,\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what youâll say now!â he was still\n",
      "superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over\n",
      "Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Soniaâs lodging, he\n",
      "felt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the\n",
      "door, asking himself the strange question: âMust he tell her who killed\n",
      "Lizaveta?â It was a strange question because he felt at the very time\n",
      "not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could\n",
      "not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he\n",
      "only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before\n",
      "the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and\n",
      "suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the\n",
      "doorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in\n",
      "her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet\n",
      "him as though she were expecting him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat would have become of me but for you?â she said quickly, meeting\n",

      "\n",
      "âWell, Sonia?â he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, âit was\n",

      "was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,\n",
      "helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed\n",
      "through Soniaâs heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhatâs the matter?â she repeated, drawing a little away from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNothing, Sonia, donât be frightened.... Itâs nonsense. It really is\n",
      "nonsense, if you think of it,â he muttered, like a man in delirium. âWhy\n",
      "have I come to torture you?â he added suddenly, looking at her. âWhy,\n",
      "really? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia....â\n",
      "\n",
      "He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour\n",
      "before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and\n",
      "feeling a continual tremor all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, how you are suffering!â she muttered in distress, looking intently\n",
      "at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia.â He suddenly smiled, a pale\n",
      "helpless smile for two seconds. âYou remember what I meant to tell you\n",
      "yesterday?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia waited uneasily.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but\n",
      "that if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta.â\n",
      "\n",
      "She began trembling all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, here Iâve come to tell you.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen you really meant it yesterday?â she whispered with difficulty.\n",
      "âHow do you know?â she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her\n",
      "reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soniaâs face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI know.â\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHave they found him?â she asked timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen how do you know about _it_?â she asked again, hardly audibly and\n",
      "again after a minuteâs pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to her and looked very intently at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "âGuess,â he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "A shudder passed over her.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut you... why do you frighten me like this?â she said, smiling like a\n",
      "child.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI must be a great friend of _his_... since I know,â Raskolnikov went\n",
      "on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes\n",
      "away. âHe... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her\n",
      "accidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and\n",
      "he went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou canât guess, then?â he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were\n",
      "flinging himself down from a steeple.\n",
      "\n",
      "âN-no...â whispered Sonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "âTake a good look.â\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his\n",
      "heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the\n",
      "face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizavetaâs\n",
      "face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the\n",
      "wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking\n",
      "as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,\n",
      "looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and\n",
      "holding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same\n",
      "thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same\n",
      "terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left\n",
      "hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to\n",
      "get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed\n",
      "even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear\n",
      "showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost\n",
      "with the same _childish_ smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHave you guessed?â he whispered at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "âGood God!â broke in an awful wail from her bosom.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a\n",
      "moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands\n",
      "and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his\n",
      "face again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she\n",
      "tried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;\n",
      "there was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when\n",
      "she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she\n",
      "had seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for\n",
      "instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as\n",
      "soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen\n",
      "this very thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âStop, Sonia, enough! donât torture me,â he begged her miserably.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,\n",
      "but this is how it happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her\n",
      "hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat\n",
      "down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden\n",
      "she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on\n",
      "her knees before him, she did not know why.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat have you done--what have you done to yourself?â she said in\n",
      "despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms\n",
      "round him, and held him tightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you\n",
      "about that.... You donât think what you are doing.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!â she\n",
      "cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into\n",
      "violent hysterical weeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at\n",
      "once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes\n",
      "and hung on his eyelashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen you wonât leave me, Sonia?â he said, looking at her almost with\n",
      "hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, no, never, nowhere!â cried Sonia. âI will follow you, I will follow\n",
      "you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didnât I\n",
      "know you before! Why didnât you come before? Oh, dear!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHere I have come.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, now! Whatâs to be done now?... Together, together!â she repeated\n",
      "as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. âIâll follow you to\n",
      "Siberia!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to\n",
      "his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPerhaps I donât want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,â he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia looked at him quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man\n",
      "the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she\n",
      "seemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She\n",
      "knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all\n",
      "these questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not\n",
      "believe it: âHe, he is a murderer! Could it be true?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhatâs the meaning of it? Where am I?â she said in complete\n",
      "bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. âHow could you,\n",
      "you, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does\n",
      "it mean?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,â he answered wearily, almost\n",
      "with vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, Sonia, no,â he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. âI was\n",
      "not so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... thatâs\n",
      "not the real thing either.... Donât torture me, Sonia.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia clasped her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCould it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could\n",
      "believe it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet\n",
      "rob and murder! Ah,â she cried suddenly, âthat money you gave Katerina\n",
      "Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, Sonia,â he broke in hurriedly, âthat money was not it. Donât worry\n",
      "yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the\n",
      "day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....\n",
      "That money was mine--my own.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd _that_ money.... I donât even know really whether there was any\n",
      "money,â he added softly, as though reflecting. âI took a purse off her\n",
      "neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...\n",
      "but I didnât look in it; I suppose I hadnât time.... And the\n",
      "things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next\n",
      "morning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now....â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia strained every nerve to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?â she\n",
      "asked quickly, catching at a straw.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât know.... I havenât yet decided whether to take that money or\n",
      "not,â he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he\n",
      "gave a brief ironical smile. âAch, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?â\n",
      "\n",
      "The thought flashed through Soniaâs mind, wasnât he mad? But she\n",
      "dismissed it at once. âNo, it was something else.â She could make\n",
      "nothing of it, nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo you know, Sonia,â he said suddenly with conviction, âlet me tell\n",
      "you: if Iâd simply killed because I was hungry,â laying stress on\n",
      "every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, âI should\n",
      "be _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you,â he\n",
      "cried a moment later with a sort of despair, âwhat would it matter to\n",
      "you if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such\n",
      "a stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that Iâve come to you\n",
      "to-day?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âGo where?â asked Sonia timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNot to steal and not to murder, donât be anxious,â he smiled bitterly.\n",
      "âWe are so different.... And you know, Sonia, itâs only now, only this\n",
      "moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!\n",
      "Yesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one\n",
      "thing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You wonât leave me,\n",
      "Sonia?â\n",
      "\n",
      "She squeezed his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?â he cried a minute\n",
      "later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. âHere you expect\n",
      "an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see\n",
      "that. But what can I tell you? You wonât understand and will only suffer\n",
      "misery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.\n",
      "Why do you do it? Because I couldnât bear my burden and have come to\n",
      "throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can\n",
      "you love such a mean wretch?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut arenât you suffering, too?â cried Sonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an\n",
      "instant softened it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great\n",
      "deal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldnât have\n",
      "come. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! Thatâs\n",
      "not the point. I must speak now, but I donât know how to begin.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused and sank into thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAch, we are so different,â he cried again, âwe are not alike. And why,\n",
      "why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, no, it was a good thing you came,â cried Sonia. âItâs better I\n",
      "should know, far better!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at her with anguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat if it were really that?â he said, as though reaching a conclusion.\n",
      "âYes, thatâs what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I\n",
      "killed her.... Do you understand now?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âN-no,â Sonia whispered naÃ¯vely and timidly. âOnly speak, speak, I shall\n",
      "understand, I shall understand _in myself_!â she kept begging him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYouâll understand? Very well, we shall see!â He paused and was for some\n",
      "time lost in meditation.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if\n",
      "Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had\n",
      "not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his\n",
      "career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,\n",
      "there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had\n",
      "to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you\n",
      "understand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had\n",
      "been no other means? Wouldnât he have felt a pang at its being so far\n",
      "from monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I\n",

      "him that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there\n",
      "was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,\n",
      "he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!\n",
      "Well, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following\n",
      "his example. And thatâs exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,\n",
      "Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps thatâs just how it\n",
      "was.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia did not think it at all funny.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âYou are right again, Sonia. Of course thatâs all nonsense, itâs almost\n",
      "all talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely\n",
      "anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned\n",
      "to drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a\n",
      "student, but I couldnât keep myself at the university and was forced\n",
      "for a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten\n",
      "or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or\n",
      "clerk with a salary of a thousand roublesâ (he repeated it as though it\n",

      "thing to pass everything by all oneâs life, to turn oneâs back upon\n",
      "everything, to forget oneâs mother and decorously accept the insults\n",
      "inflicted on oneâs sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to\n",
      "burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again\n",
      "without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old womanâs\n",
      "money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,\n",
      "to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving\n",
      "it--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up\n",
      "a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....\n",
      "Well... thatâs all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did\n",
      "wrong.... Well, thatâs enough.â\n",
      "\n",

      "of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.\n",
      "But her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew\n",

      "and begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their\n",

      "the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,\n",
      "which made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most\n",
      "furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had\n",

      "room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still\n",
      "flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were\n",
      "followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed\n",
      "to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who\n",
      "were trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the\n",
      "Kapernaumovsâ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange\n",
      "appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his\n",
      "wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several\n",
      "open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him\n",
      "with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having\n",
      "noticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The\n",
      "official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now\n",
      "for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased\n",
      "for a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at\n",
      "Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with\n",
      "a handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the\n",
      "bed, supporting her on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhere are the children?â she said in a faint voice. âYouâve brought\n",

      "\n",
      "Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,\n",

      "enough! The ball is over.â (Cough!) âLay me down, let me die in peace.â\n",
      "\n",
      "They laid her back on the pillow.\n",
      "\n",

      "She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,\n",

      "that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each otherâs\n",

      "She wasnât âa louse,â you knowâ (he pointed to the corner where the\n",

      "\n",
      "A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had\n",
      "fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there\n",
      "was no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his\n",
      "mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with\n",
      "intervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been\n",
      "mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date\n",
      "of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his\n",
      "recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what\n",
      "other people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained\n",
      "events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At\n",
      "times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes\n",
      "to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,\n",
      "of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous\n",
      "terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes\n",
      "seen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape\n",
      "from a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential\n",
      "facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome\n",
      "to him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the\n",
      "neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable\n",
      "ruin.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was particularly worried about SvidrigaÃ¯lov, he might be said to be\n",
      "permanently thinking of SvidrigaÃ¯lov. From the time of SvidrigaÃ¯lovâs\n",
      "too menacing and unmistakable words in Soniaâs room at the moment of\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovnaâs death, the normal working of his mind seemed to\n",
      "break down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,\n",
      "Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding\n",
      "himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched\n",
      "eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had\n",
      "come there, he suddenly thought of SvidrigaÃ¯lov. He recognised\n",
      "suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an\n",
      "understanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking\n",
      "outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had\n",
      "fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for SvidrigaÃ¯lov. Another\n",
      "time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes\n",
      "and could not at first understand how he had come there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovnaâs death, he\n",
      "had two or three times met SvidrigaÃ¯lov at Soniaâs lodging, where he\n",
      "had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no\n",
      "reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not\n",
      "to speak of it for a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovnaâs body was still lying in the coffin, SvidrigaÃ¯lov was\n",
      "busy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At\n",
      "their last meeting SvidrigaÃ¯lov informed Raskolnikov that he had made\n",
      "an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovnaâs\n",
      "children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting\n",
      "hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at\n",
      "once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled\n",
      "on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place\n",
      "orphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something\n",
      "too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see\n",
      "Raskolnikov, mentioning that âhe would like to consult with him, that\n",
      "there were things they must talk over....â\n",
      "\n",
      "This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. SvidrigaÃ¯lov\n",
      "looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,\n",
      "dropping his voice, asked: âBut how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you\n",
      "donât seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you donât seem to\n",
      "understand. Cheer up! Weâll talk things over; I am only sorry, Iâve\n",
      "so much to do of my own business and other peopleâs. Ah, Rodion\n",
      "Romanovitch,â he added suddenly, âwhat all men need is fresh air, fresh\n",
      "air... more than anything!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who\n",
      "were coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lovâs orders it was sung twice a day punctually. SvidrigaÃ¯lov\n",
      "went his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed\n",
      "the priest into Soniaâs room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,\n",
      "slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the\n",
      "thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive\n",
      "and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem\n",
      "service. And there was something else here as well, too awful and\n",
      "disturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the\n",
      "coffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it\n",
      "were, timidly weeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThese last two days she hasnât said a word to me, she hasnât glanced at\n",
      "me,â Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;\n",
      "the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, âGive rest, oh Lord....â\n",
      " Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and\n",
      "took his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,\n",
      "Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her\n",
      "head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered\n",
      "Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of\n",
      "repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the\n",
      "furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt\n",
      "very miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he\n",
      "would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life\n",
      "there. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had\n",
      "never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to\n",
      "the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier\n",
      "the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near\n",
      "him. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he\n",
      "made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter\n",
      "restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt\n",
      "easier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour\n",
      "listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively\n",
      "enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,\n",
      "as though his conscience smote him. âHere I sit listening to singing,\n",
      "is that what I ought to be doing?â he thought. Yet he felt at once\n",
      "that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something\n",
      "requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly\n",
      "understand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. âNo, better the\n",
      "struggle again! Better Porfiry again... or SvidrigaÃ¯lov.... Better some\n",
      "challenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!â he thought. He went out of\n",
      "the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and\n",
      "his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke\n",
      "up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling\n",
      "all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he\n",
      "arrived. After some hoursâ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up\n",
      "late, two oâclock in the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remembered that Katerina Ivanovnaâs funeral had been fixed for that\n",
      "day, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him\n",
      "some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His\n",
      "head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three\n",
      "days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened and Razumihin came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh, heâs eating, then heâs not ill,â said Razumihin. He took a chair\n",
      "and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident\n",
      "annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though\n",
      "he had some special fixed determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "âListen,â he began resolutely. âAs far as I am concerned, you may all go\n",
      "to hell, but from what I see, itâs clear to me that I canât make head or\n",
      "tail of it; please donât think Iâve come to ask you questions. I donât\n",
      "want to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say\n",
      "I shouldnât stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come\n",
      "to find out once for all whether itâs a fact that you are mad? There is\n",
      "a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit\n",
      "Iâve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,\n",
      "repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior\n",
      "to your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them\n",
      "as you have; so you must be mad.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhen did you see them last?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âJust now. Havenât you seen them since then? What have you been doing\n",
      "with yourself? Tell me, please. Iâve been to you three times already.\n",
      "Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up\n",
      "her mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she\n",
      "wouldnât hear a word. âIf he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can\n",
      "look after him like his mother?â she said. We all came here together, we\n",
      "couldnât let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.\n",
      "We came in, you werenât here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,\n",
      "while we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: âIf heâs\n",
      "gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, itâs\n",
      "humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for\n",
      "kindness.â She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.\n",
      "âI see,â she said, âthat he has time for _his girl_.â She means by _your\n",
      "girl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I donât know. I\n",
      "went at once to Sofya Semyonovnaâs, for I wanted to know what was going\n",
      "on. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I\n",
      "apologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So thatâs all\n",
      "nonsense and you havenât got a girl; the most likely thing is that you\n",
      "are mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though youâd not had\n",
      "a bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but\n",
      "though you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That Iâd\n",
      "swear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,\n",
      "for thereâs some mystery, some secret about it, and I donât intend to\n",
      "worry my brains over your secrets. So Iâve simply come to swear at you,â\n",

      "this very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought\n",
      "Iâd return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked\n",

      "that? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you\n",
      "afterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for\n",
      "anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadnât? What\n",

      "a time, I shall get hold of something else--I shanât lose what I want,\n",
      "anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;\n",
      "itâs out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,\n",
      "which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did\n",
      "reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and\n",
      "blurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a\n",
      "man lose all patience, though even then itâs rare. I was capable of\n",
      "realising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact\n",
      "to go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not\n",
      "merely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get\n",
      "something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising\n",
      "results indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,\n",

      "the Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of\n",
      "the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide\n",
      "open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were\n",
      "full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and\n",

      "desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls\n",
      "could be heard in the distance. On the table before SvidrigaÃ¯lov stood\n",
      "an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found\n",
      "also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl\n",
      "of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with\n",
      "ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some\n",

      "\n",
      "âCome, thatâs enough,â SvidrigaÃ¯lov stopped her at Raskolnikovâs\n",

      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him\n",

      "apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep\n",
      "for the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there\n",

      "mechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet\n",

      "was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,\n",
      "embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,\n",
      "mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even\n",
      "tears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for\n",
      "propaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on\n",
      "my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally\n",
      "resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the\n",
      "female heart, a weapon which never fails one. Itâs the well-known\n",
      "resource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the\n",
      "truth and nothing easier than flattery. If thereâs the hundredth part\n",
      "of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that\n",
      "leads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it\n",
      "is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be\n",
      "a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the\n",
      "flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. Thatâs so for all\n",
      "stages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be\n",
      "seduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once\n",
      "seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her\n",
      "principles. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really\n",
      "had principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being\n",
      "utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her\n",
      "shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of\n",
      "the hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having\n",
      "snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that\n",
      "I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.\n",
      "I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my\n",
      "treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In\n",
      "fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was\n",
      "innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and\n",
      "had succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I\n",
      "explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was\n",
      "just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of\n",
      "flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property\n",
      "settled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine\n",
      "now and talking too much.) I hope you wonât be angry if I mention now\n",
      "that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.\n",
      "But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had\n",
      "several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by\n",
      "the expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a\n",
      "light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and\n",
      "more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,\n",
      "but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the\n",
      "coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha\n",
      "came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a\n",
      "tremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your\n",
      "sisterâs eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this\n",
      "moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.\n",
      "I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of\n",
      "her dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think\n",
      "that I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could\n",
      "be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,\n",
      "but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what\n",
      "a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake\n",
      "anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya\n",
      "Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, thatâs not the word...\n",

      "are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty\n",
      "thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with\n",
      "me here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,\n",
      "rapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time\n",
      "that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat\n",
      "and to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in\n",
      "the catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I\n",
      "was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly\n",
      "attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would\n",

      "there was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you\n",

      "least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.\n",
      "For you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing\n",
      "actually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you. How\n",
      "should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?\n",
      "So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.\n",

      "no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your\n",
      "own accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to\n",
      "circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think\n",
      "about it. Your brotherâs and your motherâs fate are in your hands. I\n",

      "and laid it in her hand on the table. SvidrigaÃ¯lov jumped up.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAha! So thatâs it, is it?â he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously.\n",
      "âWell, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. Youâve made things\n",
      "wonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the\n",
      "revolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, itâs my revolver, an old friend!\n",

      "\n",
      "âItâs not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,\n",

      "\n",
      "âThatâs a lie,â there was a flash of fury in Douniaâs eyes, âthatâs a\n",

      "\n",
      "âA lie? Well, if you like, itâs a lie. I made it up. Women ought not\n",
      "to be reminded of such things,â he smiled. âI know you will shoot, you\n",
      "pretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the\n",
      "distance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was\n",
      "white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had\n",
      "never seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment\n",
      "she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of\n",
      "anguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The\n",
      "bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and\n",
      "laughed softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. Whatâs this?\n",
      "Blood?â he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed\n",
      "in a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just\n",
      "grazed the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at SvidrigaÃ¯lov not so much in\n",
      "terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what\n",
      "she was doing and what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, you missed! Fire again, Iâll wait,â said SvidrigaÃ¯lov softly,\n",
      "still smiling, but gloomily. âIf you go on like that, I shall have time\n",
      "to seize you before you cock again.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLet me be,â she cried in despair. âI swear Iâll shoot again. I... Iâll\n",
      "kill you.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you donât...\n",
      "then.â His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot\n",
      "again: it missed fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou havenât loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge\n",
      "there. Get it ready, Iâll wait.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild\n",
      "determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia\n",
      "saw that he would sooner die than let her go. âAnd... now, of course she\n",
      "would kill him, at two paces!â Suddenly she flung away the revolver.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSheâs dropped it!â said SvidrigaÃ¯lov with surprise, and he drew a deep\n",
      "breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only\n",
      "the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.\n",
      "It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,\n",
      "which he could not himself have defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not\n",
      "resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.\n",
      "He tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to\n",
      "utter a sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLet me go,â Dounia implored. SvidrigaÃ¯lov shuddered. Her voice now was\n",
      "quite different.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen you donât love me?â he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd... and you canât? Never?â he whispered in despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNever!â\n",
      "\n",
      "There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly\n",
      "he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.\n",
      "Another moment passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHereâs the key.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table\n",
      "behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.\n",
      "\n",
      "âTake it! Make haste!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to\n",
      "take the key.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMake haste! Make haste!â repeated SvidrigaÃ¯lov, still without turning\n",
      "or moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that\n",
      "âmake haste.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it\n",
      "quickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she\n",
      "ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he\n",
      "slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A\n",
      "strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of\n",
      "despair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.\n",
      "He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.\n",
      "The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly\n",
      "caught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket\n",
      "three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still\n",
      "two charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He\n",
      "thought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went\n",
      "out.\n",

      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent that evening till ten oâclock going from one low haunt to\n",
      "another. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain\n",
      "\n",
      "âvillain and tyrant,â\n",
      "\n",
      "âbegan kissing Katia.â\n",
      "\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and\n",
      "the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these\n",
      "clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the\n",
      "left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure\n",
      "garden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky\n",
      "three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a\n",
      "âVauxhall,â which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was\n",
      "served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.\n",
      "A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed\n",
      "German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The\n",
      "clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for\n",
      "a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no\n",
      "possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was\n",
      "that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in\n",
      "selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his\n",
      "companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon\n",
      "belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem\n",
      "troublesome. SvidrigaÃ¯lov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of\n",
      "the garden. It was about six oâclock. He had not drunk a drop of wine\n",
      "all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than\n",
      "anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over\n",
      "the sky about ten oâclock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain\n",
      "came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the\n",
      "earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each\n",
      "flash lasted while one could count five.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the\n",
      "bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,\n",
      "putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,\n",
      "but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the\n",
      "rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room\n",
      "without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She\n",
      "was giving them tea. She received SvidrigaÃ¯lov in respectful silence,\n",
      "looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at\n",
      "once in indescribable terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.\n",
      "She timidly prepared to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,â said SvidrigaÃ¯lov, âand\n",
      "as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some\n",
      "arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to\n",
      "you, you need not tell me.â (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) âThose\n",
      "people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your\n",
      "brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them\n",
      "Iâve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had\n",
      "better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take\n",
      "them! Well now, thatâs settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the\n",
      "value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for\n",
      "yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one\n",
      "knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on\n",
      "living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no\n",
      "need for it now.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my\n",

      "donât consider...â\n",

      "âItâs for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please donât waste words\n",
      "over it. I havenât time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch\n",
      "has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.â (Sonia looked\n",
      "wildly at him, and started.) âDonât be uneasy, I know all about it from\n",
      "himself and I am not a gossip; I wonât tell anyone. It was good advice\n",
      "when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much\n",
      "better for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and\n",
      "you will follow him. Thatâs so, isnât it? And if so, youâll need money.\n",
      "Youâll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same\n",

      "he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still\n",
      "persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where\n",
      "the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky\n",
      "Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit\n",
      "at first caused great perturbation; but SvidrigaÃ¯lov could be\n",
      "very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very\n",
      "intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that SvidrigaÃ¯lov had\n",
      "probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing\n",
      "vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the\n",
      "conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct\n",
      "question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she\n",
      "were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when SvidrigaÃ¯lov\n",
      "would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and\n",
      "almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only\n",
      "by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other\n",
      "occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady\n",
      "Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his\n",
      "betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she\n",
      "had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.\n",
      "\n",

      "fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from\n",
      "him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present\n",
      "before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his\n",
      "immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that\n",
      "purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went\n",
      "off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,\n",
      "the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the\n",
      "other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced\n",
      "by tears from the most sensible of mothers. SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up,\n",
      "laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon\n",
      "come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a\n",
      "sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though\n",
      "he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be\n",
      "immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He\n",
      "went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but\n",
      "the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of\n",
      "the most important of their doubts, concluding that SvidrigaÃ¯lov was\n",
      "a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great\n",
      "wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start\n",
      "off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that\n",
      "there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he\n",
      "was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,\n",
      "and all these people of high society didnât think of what was said of\n",
      "them and didnât stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that\n",
      "on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a\n",
      "word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and\n",
      "the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the\n",
      "cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said\n",
      "to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up\n",

      "\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the\n",
      "way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring\n",
      "wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black\n",
      "waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.\n",
      "But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and\n",
      "went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long\n",
      "time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the\n",
      "wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side\n",
      "of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that\n",
      "there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly\n",
      "large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was\n",
      "not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place\n",
      "that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,\n",
      "blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were\n",
      "lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked\n",
      "a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,\n",
      "scanning SvidrigaÃ¯lov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a\n",
      "close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under\n",
      "the stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow\n",
      "looked inquiringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs there tea?â asked SvidrigaÃ¯lov.\n",
      "\n",

      "âBring me tea and veal.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd you want nothing else?â he asked with apparent surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNothing, nothing.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt must be a nice place,â thought SvidrigaÃ¯lov. âHow was it I didnât\n",
      "know it? I expect I look as if I came from a cafÃ© chantant and have\n",
      "had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed\n",
      "here?â\n",
      "\n",
      "He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a\n",
      "room so low-pitched that SvidrigaÃ¯lov could only just stand up in it;\n",
      "it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained\n",
      "chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they\n",
      "were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty\n",
      "that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general\n",
      "colour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short\n",
      "by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under\n",
      "the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into\n",
      "thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout\n",
      "in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from\n",
      "the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and\n",
      "almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw\n",
      "light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The\n",
      "room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of\n",
      "them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing\n",
      "in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to\n",
      "preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached\n",
      "the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He\n",
      "declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn\n",
      "him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it\n",
      "all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the\n",
      "air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but canât. He sometimes\n",
      "turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not\n",
      "the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A\n",
      "candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly\n",
      "empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs\n",
      "of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, SvidrigaÃ¯lov turned away\n",
      "indifferently and sat down on the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking\n",
      "him again whether he didnât want anything more, and again receiving a\n",
      "negative reply, finally withdrew. SvidrigaÃ¯lov made haste to drink a\n",
      "glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began\n",
      "to feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the\n",
      "blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. âIt would have been better\n",
      "to be well for the occasion,â he thought with a smile. The room was\n",
      "close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard\n",
      "a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of\n",
      "leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He\n",
      "felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. âIt must be a garden\n",
      "under the window,â he thought. âThereâs a sound of trees. How I dislike\n",
      "the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a\n",
      "horrid feeling.â He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed\n",
      "Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little\n",
      "Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. âI never have\n",
      "liked water,â he thought, âeven in a landscape,â and he suddenly smiled\n",
      "again at a strange idea: âSurely now all these questions of taste and\n",
      "comfort ought not to matter, but Iâve become more particular, like an\n",
      "animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought\n",
      "to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,\n",
      "ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why\n",
      "havenât I put out the candle?â he blew it out. âTheyâve gone to bed next\n",
      "door,â he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. âWell, now, Marfa\n",
      "Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; itâs dark, and the very\n",
      "time and place for you. But now you wonât come!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on\n",
      "Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihinâs\n",
      "keeping. âI suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to\n",
      "tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! Heâs gone through a\n",
      "good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when heâs got over\n",
      "his nonsense. But now heâs _too_ eager for life. These young men\n",
      "are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please\n",
      "himself, itâs nothing to do with me.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not get to sleep. By degrees Douniaâs image rose before him,\n",
      "and a shudder ran over him. âNo, I must give up all that now,â he\n",
      "thought, rousing himself. âI must think of something else. Itâs queer\n",
      "and funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly\n",
      "desired to avenge myself even, and thatâs a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad\n",
      "sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--thatâs\n",
      "a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!\n",
      "But--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me\n",
      "somehow....â\n",
      "\n",
      "He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Douniaâs image\n",
      "rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,\n",
      "she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that\n",
      "he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand\n",
      "to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that\n",
      "instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his\n",
      "heart...\n",
      "\n",
      "âAÃ¯e! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly\n",
      "something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He\n",
      "started. âUgh! hang it! I believe itâs a mouse,â he thought, âthatâs the\n",
      "veal I left on the table.â He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the\n",
      "blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over\n",
      "his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking\n",
      "with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.\n",
      "He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.\n",
      "He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without\n",
      "leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and\n",
      "suddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one\n",
      "instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down\n",
      "his back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket\n",
      "as before. The wind was howling under the window. âHow disgusting,â he\n",
      "thought with annoyance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the\n",
      "window. âItâs better not to sleep at all,â he decided. There was a cold\n",
      "damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the\n",
      "blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of\n",
      "anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,\n",
      "incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his\n",
      "mind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or\n",
      "the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees\n",
      "roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling\n",
      "on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,\n",
      "warm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country\n",
      "cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with\n",
      "flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was\n",
      "surrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with\n",
      "rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed\n",
      "particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant\n",
      "narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was\n",
      "reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came\n",
      "into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,\n",
      "the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.\n",
      "The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows\n",
      "were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were\n",
      "chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table\n",
      "covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was\n",
      "covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of\n",
      "flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a\n",
      "white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as\n",
      "though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was\n",
      "a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of\n",
      "her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her\n",
      "pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle\n",
      "beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.\n",
      "She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed\n",
      "herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish\n",
      "soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn\n",
      "from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on\n",
      "a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....\n",
      "\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the\n",
      "window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously\n",
      "into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with\n",
      "his shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been\n",
      "something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,\n",
      "probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of\n",
      "rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as\n",
      "in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of\n",
      "objects. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,\n",
      "gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed\n",
      "by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. âAh, the\n",
      "signal! The river is overflowing,â he thought. âBy morning it will be\n",
      "swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and\n",
      "cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain\n",
      "and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is\n",
      "it now?â And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on\n",
      "the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? Iâll go out at once\n",
      "straight to the park. Iâll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,\n",
      "so that as soon as oneâs shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on\n",
      "oneâs head.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his\n",
      "waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,\n",
      "into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep\n",
      "somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay\n",
      "him for the room and leave the hotel. âItâs the best minute; I couldnât\n",
      "choose a better.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding\n",
      "anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner\n",
      "between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object\n",
      "which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little\n",
      "girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her\n",
      "clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big\n",
      "black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been\n",
      "crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The childâs face\n",
      "was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. âHow can she have come here?\n",
      "She must have hidden here and not slept all night.â He began questioning\n",
      "her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby\n",
      "language, something about âmammyâ and that âmammy would beat her,â and\n",
      "about some cup that she had âbwoken.â The child chattered on without\n",
      "stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a\n",
      "neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service\n",
      "of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken\n",
      "a cup of her motherâs and was so frightened that she had run away the\n",

      "and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his\n",
      "arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing\n",
      "her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as\n",
      "wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had\n",
      "undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in\n",
      "the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he\n",
      "sank into dreary musing again.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat folly to trouble myself,â he decided suddenly with an oppressive\n",
      "feeling of annoyance. âWhat idiocy!â In vexation he took up the candle\n",
      "to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.\n",
      "âDamn the child!â he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again\n",
      "to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.\n",
      "The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,\n",
      "and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed\n",
      "brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. âItâs a flush\n",
      "of fever,â thought SvidrigaÃ¯lov. It was like the flush from drinking, as\n",
      "though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were\n",
      "hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long\n",
      "black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a\n",
      "sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little\n",
      "girl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in\n",
      "a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to\n",
      "control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,\n",
      "a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite\n",
      "unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the\n",
      "shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they\n",
      "turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited\n",
      "him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that\n",
      "laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. âWhat,\n",
      "at five years old?â SvidrigaÃ¯lov muttered in genuine horror. âWhat does\n",
      "it mean?â And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding\n",
      "out her arms.... âAccursed child!â SvidrigaÃ¯lov cried, raising his hand\n",
      "to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not\n",
      "been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâve had nightmare all night!â He got up angrily, feeling utterly\n",
      "shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could\n",
      "see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,\n",
      "put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his\n",
      "pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his\n",
      "pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few\n",
      "lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his\n",
      "elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some\n",
      "flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on\n",
      "the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began\n",
      "trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.\n",
      "At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he\n",
      "started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he\n",
      "was in the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thick milky mist hung over the town. SvidrigaÃ¯lov walked along the\n",
      "slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing\n",
      "the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,\n",
      "the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the\n",
      "bush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think\n",
      "of something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.\n",
      "The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with\n",
      "their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and\n",
      "he began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read\n",
      "each carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and\n",
      "came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with\n",
      "its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead\n",
      "drunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower\n",
      "stood up on the left. âBah!â he shouted, âhere is a place. Why should\n",
      "it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness\n",
      "anyway....â\n",
      "\n",
      "He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where\n",

      "the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,\n",
      "wrapped in a grey soldierâs coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his\n",

      "printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes\n",

      "convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a\n",
      "year and a half has passed since his crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered\n",
      "exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor\n",
      "misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit\n",
      "the smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the\n",
      "secret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which\n",
      "was found in the murdered womanâs hand. He described minutely how he\n",
      "had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its\n",
      "contents; he explained the mystery of Lizavetaâs murder; described how\n",
      "Koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said\n",
      "to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay\n",
      "and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards\n",
      "gone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the\n",
      "Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.\n",
      "The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the\n",
      "judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he\n",
      "had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making\n",
      "use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the\n",
      "trinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had\n",
      "never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed\n",
      "incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and\n",
      "seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,\n",
      "some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the\n",
      "damp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man\n",
      "should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made\n",
      "a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers\n",
      "more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really\n",
      "not looked into the purse, and so didnât know what was in it when he\n",
      "hid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that\n",
      "the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental\n",
      "derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of\n",
      "gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary\n",
      "insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover\n",
      "Raskolnikovâs hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by\n",
      "Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.\n",
      "All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not\n",
      "quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another\n",
      "element in the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the\n",
      "criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question\n",
      "as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he\n",
      "answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was\n",
      "his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to\n",
      "provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand\n",
      "roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder\n",
      "through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by\n",
      "privation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he\n",
      "answered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost\n",
      "coarse....\n",
      "\n",
      "The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,\n",
      "perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,\n",
      "but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange\n",
      "and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.\n",
      "There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition\n",
      "of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he\n",
      "had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his\n",
      "abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the\n",

      "at last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have\n",
      "his own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,\n",

      "crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a\n",
      "rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that\n",

      "He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When\n",
      "he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish\n",
      "and delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a\n",
      "terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of\n",
      "Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts\n",
      "of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were\n",
      "endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once\n",
      "mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual\n",
      "and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never\n",
      "had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their\n",
      "moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples\n",
      "went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand\n",
      "one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched\n",
      "looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung\n",
      "his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to\n",
      "consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom\n",
      "to justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They\n",
      "gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march\n",
      "the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken\n",
      "and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting\n",
      "and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in\n",
      "the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was\n",
      "summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,\n",
      "because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they\n",
      "could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed\n",
      "on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something\n",
      "quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,\n",
      "fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All\n",
      "men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and\n",
      "moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole\n",
      "world. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and\n",
      "a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these\n",

      "Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so\n",
      "miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.\n",
      "The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring\n",
      "days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel\n",
      "paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during\n",
      "his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was\n",
      "difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially\n",
      "in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the\n",
      "windows of the ward.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On\n",
      "waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the\n",
      "distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.\n",
      "Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and\n",
      "moved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day\n",
      "after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was\n",
      "discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that\n",
      "her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,\n",
      "Sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,\n",
      "that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and\n",
      "see him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six oâclock, he\n",
      "went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster\n",
      "and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only\n",
      "three of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the\n",
      "fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and\n",
      "laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river\n",
      "bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the\n",
      "wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before\n",
      "him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.\n",
      "In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black\n",
      "specks, the nomadsâ tents. There there was freedom, there other men were\n",
      "living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand\n",
      "still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.\n",
      "Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into\n",
      "contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited\n",
      "and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up\n",
      "noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the\n",
      "morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the\n",
      "green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and\n",
      "paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand\n",
      "with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand\n",
      "to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would\n",
      "repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always\n",
      "seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout\n",
      "her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply\n",
      "grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance\n",
      "at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were\n",
      "alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to\n",
      "seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round\n",
      "her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she\n",
      "turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same\n",
      "moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her\n",
      "eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and\n",
      "that at last the moment had come....\n",
      "\n",
      "They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They\n",
      "were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the\n",
      "dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were\n",
      "renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the\n",
      "heart of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to\n",
      "wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before\n",
      "them! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his\n",
      "being, while she--she only lived in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,\n",
      "Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied\n",
      "that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him\n",
      "differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered\n",
      "him in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound\n",
      "to be so. Wasnât everything now bound to be changed?\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her\n",
      "and wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.\n",
      "But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what\n",
      "infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all,\n",
      "_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence\n",
      "and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an\n",
      "external, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not\n",
      "think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have\n",
      "analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped\n",
      "into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself\n",
      "out in his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.\n",
      "The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the\n",
      "raising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry\n",
      "him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with\n",
      "books. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject\n",
      "and had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it\n",
      "himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without\n",
      "a word. Till now he had not opened it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: âCan\n",
      "her convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at\n",
      "least....â\n",
      "\n",
      "She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken\n",
      "ill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was\n",
      "almost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, _only_ seven years! At\n",
      "the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready\n",
      "to look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not\n",

      "      Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\n",
      "      Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly\n",
      "      hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all\n",
      "      the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them\n",
      "      is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment\n",

      "    </p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "      In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these\n",
      "      heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain\n",
      "      mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right Whale’s sadly\n",
      "      lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head. As you behold\n",
      "      it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of\n",
      "      pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is\n",
      "      heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving\n",
      "      token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the\n",
      "      fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "      Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the\n",
      "      two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of\n",
      "      the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you\n",
      "      narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\n",
      "      fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\n",
      "      magnitude of the head.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "      Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is plain\n",
      "      that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he\n",
      "      can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s eyes\n",
      "      corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how\n",
      "      it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears.\n",
      "      You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision\n",
      "      in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more\n",
      "      behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with\n",
      "      dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more\n",
      "      than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have\n",
      "      two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\n",

      "<p>\n",
      "      Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\n",

      "      head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes\n",
      "      in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which\n",

      "      distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side;\n",
      "      while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man\n",
      "      may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with\n",
      "      two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are\n",
      "      separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the\n",
      "      view. This peculiarity of the whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne\n",

      "      hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is\n",
      "      involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever\n",
      "      objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience will teach him,\n",
      "      that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one\n",
      "      glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to\n",
      "      examine any two things—however large or however small—at one\n",
      "      and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and\n",
      "      touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and\n",
      "      surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one\n",
      "      of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other\n",
      "      will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,\n",
      "      then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\n",
      "      simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\n",
      "      combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the same moment of time\n",
      "      attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and\n",
      "      the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as\n",
      "      marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go\n",
      "      through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor,\n",
